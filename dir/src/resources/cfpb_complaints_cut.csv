Please be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 { b } that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. 

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. I  respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time, I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX, XXXX or XXXX  } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character If your offices can provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 

Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when in fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 

If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX, XXXX and XXXX   } request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by XXXX. 

It would be advisable that you assure your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action against your company and your client. This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

The information they sent me did not include a copy of my ID or drivers license and the signature is not mines however this company continues to report tradeline to the 3 major credit bureaus. This is creating major issues for me such as job declines, higher interest rates, lower credit scores, and application rejects for balances owed. I believe this account DOES NOT belong to me, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act all unverified accounts must be deleted. I contacted the apartment complex XXXX XXXX XXXX directly which they advised they don't have any information pertaining to previous residents. That also stated that XXXX was a previous apt management company that managed billing and is no longer in business. I contacted the corporate office which stated they have no information due to XXXX managing in the past and they are no longer in business. They stated they are under new management and unable to assist me, so HOW DID PROCOLLECT PROPERLY VALDATE THIS DEBT? The only information I received from ProCollect was a copy of a application, detailed bill, and a copy of a lease that I allegedly signed which I DID NOT. These items do not qualify as full verification per FCRA. This company is in violation for continuing to verify the accounts with the credit bureaus without providing the proper evidence as requested. A fraud alert has been on my credit report due to my identity being stolen, so a copy of my ID or Drivers license should be on file for verification purposes, and none was sent with the information Procollect sent me. The information on the application DOES NOT belong to me, THE SIGNATURE is NOT MINES. I never lived on XXXX XXXX which is listed on the apartment application, anyone can have my employment information.

I have repeatedly explained all of this to XXXX and to TransUnion. 
I have even provided, in writing and over the phone, the phone numbers and the names of officials at XXXX  who confirm that there is no debt, and that there has never been an account under my name, ssn, phone number, nor address.

I was transferred to his supervisornamed XXXX who researched the matter and AGAIN states that there has never been an account associated with me. There is no debt. 
I was then transferred to another individual named XXXX who AGAIN confirmed that there has never been an account associated with me. 
No matter how many times I dispute the matter, "" XXXX XXXX "" refuses to send any copy of anything to me to support a claim.

No one has anything to indicate what the alleged debt was for. 
2. XXXX agrees that there ihas never been such a debt and there is no basis whatsoever for a claim, since they have never had an account associated with me.

2019-09-02,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Improper use of your report,Credit inquiries on your report that you don't recognize,"On XX/XX/2019, I arrived at a Banana Republic store to do some shopping. I hold a Banana Republic store credit card administered by Synchrony Bank. However, I realized at the check out counter that I had left this card at home. So began a series of unfortunate events. The Banana Republic representative checking me out tried to access my account by prompting me for my social security number, without success. When that didn't work, I worried the issue was that I had not yet activated the new card that had been sent in the mail some weeks prior. The Banana Republic representative thought it likely that this was the problem and offered reactivating my account as the best resolution. The reactivation process strongly resembled the process for opening a new account, so on several occasions I verified with the representative that the process would *not* open a new account. I also explicitly verified with the representative that this process would not result in a hard credit inquiry. However, the representative was wrong on both accounts. When I returned home I received an email from XXXX XXXX alerting me to a new inquiry against my credit and, upon logging into my online Synchrony Bank account, I found that a new Banana Republic credit card account had been opened. I promptly closed the new account and called Synchrony Bank to request that the inquiry be removed from my credit report. On XX/XX/2019 I received the attached letter from Synchrony Bank denying my request. 

It seems unreasonable to expect a consumer, faced with a company representative that says one thing and a company document that says another, to be responsible for discerning which source is correct. I hope that Banana Republic and Synchrony Bank will recognize their responsibility to resolve this conflict by removing the hard inquiry against my credit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,MO,63125,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3360199,"38.52,-90.3"

2019-09-02,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"As stated in Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212 Guide to Original Issue Discount ( OID ) Instruments ; OID is a form of interest. It is the excess of a debt instruments stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price ( acquisition price for a stripped bond or coupon ). Zero coupon bonds and debt instruments that pay no stated interest until maturity are examples of debt instruments that have OID. As stated in Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212 Guide to Original Issue Discount ( OID ) Instruments ; The term debt instrument means any instrument or contractual arrangement that constitutes indebtedness under general principles of federal income tax law ( including, for example, a bond, debenture, note, certificate, or other evidence of indebtedness ). It generally does not include an annuity contract. 

No contractual arrangement exists with said debt collector and it appears that said debt ( evidence of indebtedness ) was purchased pennies on the dollar from the previous Holder in Due Course/ Payor ; hence, said debt collector was not authorized to furnish private information or assume to be the Power of Attorney regarding myself ( Identity Theft ) ; Consequently, the debt is considered void. Nevertheless, it appears that said debt collector is persistent by way of said consumer credit report stating that a debt is owed. However, said evidence of debt constitutes indebtedness under general principles of federal income tax law. The debt collector is considered the Holder in Due Course/ Payor and are liable for the federally withheld amount of {$330.00}. Consequently, said debt collector has committed the following violations regarding said debt instrument ( s ) : failed to provide a 1099 OID regarding said debt instrument ( s ), failed to report income, failed to withheld tax, failed to file return, and failed to pay tax.

it is impossible to furnish information to the Credit Reporting Agencies without first assessing the tax accordingly regarding said debt instrument ( s ) ; Otherwise it is evident that said debt collector knowingly participated in a transaction to effectuate criminal or fraudulent avoidance of tax liability. As the recipient of said debt instrument ( s ), I am being hindered from assessing said tax accordingly by way of form 1099 OID and 1040. Consequently, said debt collector has intentionally impacted ones credit worthiness negatively regarding said debt instrument ( s ) which is  considered irrefutable proof that the debt collector does not respect the general principles of the federal income tax law. 

Attach you will find Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212 Guide to Original Issue Discount ( OID ) Instruments, Pages 1 and 2 ; Emphasis on the following Definitions ( Circled ) : Original Issue Discount ( OID ) and Debt Instrument, Credit Report ( Emphasis on the highlighted area ) regarding proof said debt collector participated in a transaction to effectuate criminal or fraudulent avoidance of tax liability ; hence, does not respect the general principles of the federal income tax law. The following forms have been prepared accordingly and are on standby should any issue arise regarding said complaint in association with said debt collector : Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue Service Form 3949-A - Information Referral and Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue Service Form 211 - Application for Award for Original Information. All statements/ responses regarding said complaint will be forwarded to the Internal Revenue Service along with said forms in order to substantiate my complaint.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Sequium Asset Solutions, LLC",FL,33129,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3360411,"25.75,-80.2"

I defaulted on the card and it was eventually closed with comments on my credit report of "" Profit And Loss Write-off '' The account was never assigned to an agency for collection efforts nor was it purchased by a debt buyer. Based on the comments on my report indicating it had been written off, it is my concern that the company is still reporting a balance of {$650.00}. In an effort to make good on the account I have contacted the company on multiple occasions in an attempt to settle the account and or set up a payment plan. Everytime I have spoken with someone I have been advised that the account was "" closed '' and that they would need to have the account "" reactivated '' in order for them to assist in providing me with a settlement offer and or payment arrangement. When I asked them why and what the balance is the response I get is that on their end the account is closed and there is no balance which is why they need to reactivate it. If this is true then why are they reporting a balance on my credit? Just this week I was able to get clarification that the account was in "" limbo '' and with the "" client services '' department who are in charge of deciding what to do with the account. I asked to speak with them and was transferred to a phone line that rang 20+ times before hanging up. I have disputed this via the credit bureaus and they have done nothing and I have made every effort to try and rectify with the company directly. At this point this account is causing me stress and could potentially prevent me from qualifying for the rate I want to refinance my home. Based on my lenders credit simulator this account could potentially raise my score 24 points if it were updated to the correct {$0.00} balance since it was already "" written off ''",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",CA,90621,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-31,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3361349,"33.88,-117.99"

2019-08-31,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX this year I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX demanding payment on a debt that is not mine. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested further information. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX rejecting my dispute and insisting upon full payment. The letter included much less than was requested. It was at this point that I hired an attorney. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my attorney sent a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX requesting further information. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX responded with none of the of the information my attorney specifically requested. All he received were more credit card statements. 

I know for a fact that this is not my debt and that XXXX XXXX XXXX can not provide any verifiable evidence that it is. They will not provide me with any type of substantive documentation regarding this account such as the original consumer contract that my attorney asked for three months ago. And yet, on XX/XX/2019 they once again entered this same account into your system as up for collection. 

As I pointed out to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( and subsequently to Experian in the referenced dispute ) : 1 ) all correspondence from the originating bank to the debtor were sent to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. That is the person who owes this debt. I have never lived in or even visited Florida. 
Tax and real estate records will prove this. Experians own report # XXXX dated XX/XX/2019 validates this. 

2 ) we have a history of paying the balance on our credit cards every month and have done so for at least 20 years. We do not let credit card debt accumulate nor do we make late payments. A simple review of our credit history will verify this. Experians own report # XXXX dated XX/XX/2019 validates this. 


Since the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requires credit reporting companies to verify any and all accounts they post on a credit report. I would assume that they have the type of evidence I seek. If you do not then I must assume that they did not comply with that requirement. However, I have subsequently demanded to see all verifiable proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my  signature on it ) that they have on file for this account. 

Experian 's failure to positively verify these accounts has resulted in a one hundred point drop in my credit score and a change of my credit rating from very good to fair. This has already had a possible impact on the cost of my insurance premiums and will hurt my ability to obtain future credit. Further, it has damaged my reputation causing undo suffering and anguish. 

Under the FCRA, unverified accounts must be removed and if they are unable to provide me a copy of verifiable proof, they must remove this account. 

I have disputed the collections actions with Experian and await the result.

2019-08-30,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"It all started after enrollment on XX/XX/XXXX. I thought after confirmation I would be set to access my account and get my information. My nightmare began and never ended This is a formal complaint against Citi bank online banking services and CitiBanK banking. I have had issues from the time of signing up. I decided to join this financial institution. I received my bank approval email XX/XX/XXXX, and needed to get my account number to verify my account with my job for direct deposit. I call XXXX customer service line. I was advised there is a fraud alert on my account and I would need to go in to a banks branch in order to receive any details on my account. I was advise someone would follow up with me so I wont have this issue I just needed to answer some security questions. New account I assumed that was normal procedure so I obliged. The convenience of online customer service didnt apply to my account evidently. So I go in speak with a personal banker and ask is there some questions on my account that needs to be answered because I dont want to have to go into a branch every time I need to review any details about my account. He advised there was nothing on my account. I moved forward with this account I received my debit card and thought all was well I tried to activate it at home I was unable too. I was advised with online customer service that there was an alert on my account so they couldnt move forward with the call. I was baffled and confused The rep was snarky and rude as I was asking alternatives and advising her of what I was told by a personal banker at the Citibank branch on XXXX, XXXX XXXX, N.Y. I escalated the call to a team lead who was also rude. And offered no options. I then used the online banking chat system to try to receive some kind of resolve. I was given numbers to contact with reps who wouldnt continue call flow. I deposited a check and it was held I didnt know on new accounts they always hold the first check I just wanted information on that. Online chat rep adv me its on hold but would be released. I was appreciative. On XX/XX/XXXX I receive a fraud alert text that I had to reply to based on my transactions and I responded and retried transaction and eveythingis smooth sailing. Wrong I have automatic payments set up with XXXX they adv me my payment didnt go thru based on my account being frozen they advised I call the bank to try to resolve to keep me on track with my payment schedule XX/XX/XXXX. I call Citi online reps still advise me of this alert no options no help call disconnected. I go in to the Citi bank branch on XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NY. Sat with a personal banker and asked is there anything that needs to be updated on my account because Im tired of coming in for tedious inquiries about my account. I advised since XXXX has told me about this Ive called XXXX fraud dept who wouldnt speak to me a rep by the name XXXX adv he would not be disclosing any information and disconnected the call. I cried I dont know what to do how to think my bank card still works but I cant call in about my account bankers call a Citi hotline who also adv nothing is on my account they shared a screen, I asked will I have problems moving forward it was advised no. I go into the branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX to confirm nothing on my account needs updates I sat with the branch manager who again made a call to their in-house Citi hotline and both advised account is ok for use. XX/XX/XXXX I locked myself out of Citi acct app to check my statements and chat with reps. I call customer service for help XXXX adv security alert cant move forward after vigorous verification process to identify it was my account. I couldnt even be help and my online account is still locked as of today. Im confused and conflicted because Im being told nothing is wrong with my account yet online customer service doesnt review my account details with me over the phone due to this ALERT. Citi online banking chat offered me some sort of resolve. Branch reps over me quick solutions but nothing has brought complete resolve to this solution I need to be able to call in about my account. Receive updates, make changes, and receive assistance. None of the amenities of the account applies to me Im at the end of my ropes and dont know what else to do but to find another bank institution to help with my financial needs and provide the convenience of doing so.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,11221,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3358635,"40.69,-73.93"

2019-08-30,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ) wrongfully denied mortgage assistance ( loss mitigation ) we filed on XX/XX/2019 while violating RESPA loss mitigation laws. 
SPS denial letter of XX/XX/2019 ( attached ) stated Insufficient payment reduction. We are unable to offer you this program because in performing our underwriting of potential modification we could not reduce your interest and principal payment Same SPS letter of XX/XX/2019 letter listed only the following net present value ( NPV ) calculation inputs/assumptions : one numeric input ( property value ) and one unexplained valuation code ( DRVB ). 
The number of inputs cited above, allegedly used by SPS for loss mitigation NPV calculation, is inconsistent with much larger number of inputs typically needed to perform a loss mitigation NPV calculation. 
SPS did not disclose all inputs/assumptions to the net present value ( NPV ) calculation used to deny our trial or permanent loan modification eligibility as required by RESPA and CMR law. 
12 CFR 1024.41 ( d ) ( 2 ) RESPA states : If a trial or permanent loan modification is denied because of a net present value calculation ( NPV ), the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must include the inputs used in the net present value calculation. 
Additionally, 209 CMR56 requires that an NPV calculator approved by the Division of Banks, such as FDIC or HAMP or equivalent are used for loss mitigation NPV calculations. FDIC and HAMP calculator requires approximately forty or more unique inputs/assumptions to perform NPV calculation.

Attached please find the Notice of Error regarding the above matter we mailed via USPS overnight mail.

On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I filed Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy which included that loan. The bankruptcy was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, and the loan is being properly listed on my credit report as Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. 

However there is another loan listed on my credit report under XXXX XXXX. It was also reportedly issued on XX/XX/XXXX, with a last payment made date of XX/XX/XXXX, the exact dates reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX. This loan is being reported as Unpaid Balance Charged Off. I have never applied for or received a loan from XXXX XXXX, and certainly did not apply for or receive two entirely different loans on XX/XX/XXXX, as is currently claimed on my credit report. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX merged with XXXX XXXX , XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX, the company became known as XXXX XXXX. It appears that sometime between the merger and the final discharge of the debt, the account was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, resulting in a new account number. That doesn't make it a new loan or change the fact it was discharged, however. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an online dispute with TransUnion, identifying the duplication and noting this was likely the same loan reported twice. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply claiming the accounts were verified as accurate. I'm not sure how it was verified, but someone, somewhere, is mistaken. 

I contacted the main office of XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, to correct this error. I spoke with XXXX and explained the problem, and was transferred to XXXX at the XXXX XXXX, XXXX branch. After I explained again, XXXX told me that her manager, XXXX, was out of the office but would return my call the following day. On the XXXX, my wife spoke with XXXX, and explained the situation yet again. He stated repeatedly there was nothing he could do and claimed if TransUnion was saying it was verified, then it must be accurate. He suggested we contact an attorney if we had further questions. 

I am trying very hard to make sure my credit report is accurate and have hit a brick wall here. On XX/XX/XXXX, after my wife spoke with XXXX, I contacted TransUnion by phone to dispute their results and still have not received any indication that they are doing anything to correct this problem.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",MS,39700,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3358029,

2019-08-29,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I have been attempting for nearly two years to establish a plan with my mortgage company to end payment on my mortgage. I initially applied for and received approval for a loan re-modification. After paying on this for a couple of months, I decided to move forward with a non-retention plan, a short sale of the property.

I obtained the help of a real estate agent. An offer was made on the house and I completed all the required paperwork. The mortgage company never offered a response until we contacted them and were told that the offer was not sufficient. My agent spoke to the company numerous times to finally get specific answers on what was needed.

She listed the property, took pictures of the home, showed it to a dozen investors and had an offer made for over {$90000.00}. My current pay off was roughly {$120000.00}.

After 30 days passed, with no response, she reached out to the company and was told that it had not been approved because I had not completely a hardship application. I have completed this form and all provided all the supporting documentation at least four times.

Nonetheless, I did it again. I received a notification that there were corrections needed in my information. I called to find out what i needed to do and was told that the short sale was no longer an option and I could only apply for a loan modification at this time.

I have spoken to numerous representatives countless time and never gotten the same answer to any question or issue twice. My agent and I could call on the same day and get two different responses.

Throughout this extended process, the mortgage company has rarely contacted me regarding any information needed, always waiting until i contact them.

Meanwhile, I get two - three letters a week from them with different information on each one.

I feel like this entire process has been a huge run around.

I am very close to giving up and allowing it to go to foreclosure.

I am totally frustrated and confused as to why the mortgage company would reject an offer that would pay off 75 % of the remaining loan and take the property off their hands.

I feel that I have made every reasonable effort and beyond to come up with an agreeable solution to my mortgage issue.

I failed to mention that the reason I left the home and want to get out of the mortgage is that I left my husband and am now paying rent on an apartment. My ex-husband has remained in the house without paying anything toward the property. In addition to paying my own living expenses a large portion of my income is paid to him in spousal support as he is unemployed and applying for XXXX.

The company I have been dealing with is Select Portfolio Services.

I have written to their ombudsmen, but have not gotten a response at this time.

SPS has been terrible regarding communication and seem to have no desire to settle this issue.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33023,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3358438,"25.99,-80.21"

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3358065,

2019-08-28,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I signed up for a savings account promotion ( Promo Code XXXX ) that provided if I deposited {$10000.00} for 90 days I would receive a bonus of {$200.00} within 120 days of opening the account. I opened the account on XX/XX/XXXX, set up an external transfer account ( via verification of trial deposits ) and attempted to move the {$10000.00} to the account on XX/XX/XXXX. However, even though my external account was verified, there was no way to transfer the funds to my savings account ; the funds could only be transferred to a checking account. 

I called customer service and they said that I was unable to transfer funds directly to a savings account because of the limit on withdrawals ( this made no sense to me since I was transferring money into the account not transferring it out ). Regardless, the agent I spoke to ( XXXX XXXX, direct line : XXXX, NMLS XXXX ), said that I could transfer the funds to my checking account first then transfer them to my savings account and it would still constitute new money for the purpose of the promotional bonus. I did this in two transactions of {$5000.00} each into the checking account ( which were completed on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, respectively ), since there was a {$5000.00} limit in transferring the money into my checking account at that time. I then transferred the full {$10000.00} into my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

120 days after the account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX, was XX/XX/XXXX, which was a Saturday. I called the general customer service line for the bank on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX Central Standard Time ( "" CST '' ) and was told that promotional bonus distributions are made on Tuesdays. When the bonus was not deposited on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called back on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST and was told that I would not receive the bonus because the funds came into the savings account from the checking account. 

At this point, I called XXXX XXXX directly on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST, left a message, and actually spoke to XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST that morning. XXXX told me that I should receive the bonus as the funds did constitute new money. He escalated the case to his manager that day ( record number XXXX ). 

I have called several times over the past two weeks and there has been no further development. I called and left messages for XXXX on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX   CST, Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX CST, and Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX   CST. After it was clear that XXXX was no longer responding, I spoke to XXXX XXXX ( NMLS XXXX ) on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST and she told me that the escalation team had approved the promotional bonus and would be deposited by today, Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I did not receive the bonus, I called back in to check on the status at XXXX XXXX CST today, Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I was transferred to customer service, and spoke with an agent ( "" XXXX XXXX '' ) who told me that the reason my case was escalated was because the {$10000.00} was not deposited on the day my account was opened ( this is not a requirement in the terms of the promotion and the online account application offers two funding options : by check and by transferring funds from a bank account ). XXXX told me that the escalation had not been approved and there have been no further developments despite my multiple calls and attempts to move this along over the past two weeks. XXXX and I reviewed the terms of the promotion and she agreed that I had met the requirements and did not understand why the case had to be escalated. I left a message for XXXX, since what XXXX told me directly contradicts what she told me last week, but have not heard back yet and frankly, do not expect to hear back given how I have been treated so far. 

I also spoke to XXXX XXXX supervisor ( "" XXXX '' who would not give any identifying information other than that she was the only XXXX in the two contact centers the bank has in Illinois ). She confirmed the information XXXX provided and said there was nothing for me to do at this point but wait for the escalation to be approved. 

Just the calls this morning took up over an hour of my time.

NMLS # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email notification from SunTrust "" congratulating '' me on my brand new checking account - separate from my mortgage. Alarmed, I immediately contacted SunTrust to notify them that I did not open a new account and that this was clearly identity theft. The Identity Thief changed my login credentials and so I was unable to "" take back '' my account! After an hour and dealing with four different customer service reps in mortgage and their checking department, I was told to call back tomorrow and told that they could do nothing for me. I proceeded to call the next morning and spoke with a few more customer service reps including who was believed to be an important manager. The manager confirmed that my account safe and protected, to the best of her knowledge. I asked if we could somehow add an alert to protect my information, or perhaps change the loan number to prevent this from happening again. They told me that this was impossible unless I wanted to complete a refinance. I asked if this could happen again and the response was, "" sir, we're doing whatever we can, but who knows ''! 

6 days later, my account was hacked again. We expressed to SunTrust once again that our information was compromised and we wanted it to be protected. We demanded that they protect our personal information. They were short with us on the phone, wouldn't answer any questions, and essentially told us that they could do an investigation. There was no sense of urgency from SunTrust and they intentionally would NOT take any measures to protect my personal information. They wouldn't even tell us the email address of the hacker, who again, changed our account email address and phone number once again! 

My information is still exposed and after repeated calls to whomever would be willing to help, I have not gotten any response or help.

On XX/XX/2019 i had made a purchase for {$530.00} for a pair of XXXX brand sneakers. The sneakers are the XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) i had paid {$500.00} plus {$30.00} for shipping, i think the other {$7.00} were service or exchange charge. 

I was told the item would ship from the United States and were 100 % authentic, obviously i made this purchase with my credit card that had a {$0.00} balance since i paid off my card and i knew i would be safe. The transaction happened on XXXX which is a XXXX like site for the XXXX community outside of the USA but they tend to have rare shoes and items at times. 

I had placed the order and eventually i received the item 9 days later on XX/XX/2019. The item came directly from XXXX, i could not make out the return address or any other info as it was in XXXX other than for my name and address. I opened the package to see a pair of used XXXX brand basketball shoes. The shoes are red, white, and blue and were clearly worn. I immediately contacted Walmart Synchrony Bank to file a dispute. Keep in mind, i had called the same day to file the dispute. 

I tried contacting the merchant, no response, nothing. I messaged on the website multiple times a day everyday for weeks. XXXX themselves have a chat service but they could not help me, they said i had to speak to the seller then file a dispute which i did with them but they never refunded my money. I spoke to Walmart Synchrony Bank and they told me not to worry and that i will be taken care of. I have forwarded pictures of what i received and they have sent me many letters demanding information which i have faxed over 10+ times. They have closed and opened the case many times and have not helped or protected me. 

They asked me if i returned the item which many times i have responded to as NO! i did not! because i do not know any information on the seller, no one has given me a name and address, the item came from XXXX. I have ZERO information from the seller or where to send any product SO how can i return something i did NOT order to somewhere or someone i have ZERO information about??? 

I am at a loss at how a company would not help protect me when i have a proven track record, have had this card for 5+ years, always paid my bill without issue yet they will not refund my money for this clear as day scam. They can not even contact the company and credit my account, they owe me money as i have been making payments on this balance and they are screwing up my account.

I recently lost my job. Just before I did get fired, I was speaking to XXXX XXXX, a debt collector from an agency called VeriCred Solution and I had an idea/plan to make the arrangement. I also asked them to grant my brother-in-law 's request to stop calling him as he was my listed reference at the time. XXXX said ofcourse and let me know he was removed. We were supposed to talk at the end of the week but unfortunately I lost my job. I felt like the world came crashing down on me. Ever since, they became very aggressive in collecting that debt from 2014 payday loan that I owed. They already spoke to my brother-in-law and a week ago I asked to grant his request to be removed from their system which XXXX XXXX agreed to. However, they called him AGAIN!!! I called XXXX to let her know my situation. XXXX XXXX was very rude. And when I asked what happened to the request of my reference to be removed, she blamed it on their system. I was working in the XXXX using similar account/info system. It does not take a week to delete a reference on a customer 's account.

2019-08-27,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"My old apartment complex XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, IL drummed up bogus charges to cover the cost of the apartment while not being leased. For 2 years all of our rent was paid in full and on time. XXXX first sent an email for repainting for {$180.00} about 6 days after our lease was up. Then about a month later the amount they have asked for an amount that is strangely close to the amount for 1 month of rent ( around {$2000.00} ). I at least know of one bogus charge specifically they claim one charge is around {$1200.00} for a washer and dryer with a light dull blue tint in the dryer which happens when new blue jeans have been washed and dried. This is normal wear  and tear as stated in the lease and they say the washer and dryer is unserviceable because of the light blue tint.This was all strangely brought up exactly a month after we moved out. XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX specifically told us there is no final walk through for the apartment which is strange in my experience.I refused to pay the amount.A collections agency Hunter Warfield then contacted me about the debt which I disputed via registered mail when I received a letter dated XX/XX/2019 from Hunter Warfield within the 30 day period. 

Hunter Warfield has not validated or itemized the debt at all which if they did would see the charges are illegitimate.

Hunter Warfield is charging undue interest as per the original contract.The original contract only says interest is applied to late rent payments not bogus/alleged damages.

Hunter Warfield has also have sent differing amounts and by differing I mean a range of $XX/XX/XXXX- {$400.00} on most letters. 

Hunter Warfield refuses to show that they are licensed to collect this debt.

Hunter Warfield refuses to show that they have a contract to collect this debt and are not a scam.

Below is my response to Hunter Warfield. They have continued to send the same automated responses.They claim they have no responsibility to provide any such information on the debt. 


( 1 ) To address the threatening interest rates that are being displayed in your response the 5 % interest rate as per the lease only pertains to late rent payments as per the original terms and conditions of the contract not alleged damages. As per FDCPA you can not add interest or fees except those allowed by the original contract. Furthermore, even if you could charge interest, which you can not, it would not start until after debt validation which as far as our party is concerned has not been properly validated as a legitimate debt.

( 2 ) The amount owed again is unfair, ambiguous and deceptive. You have sent differing amounts in your responses. On the original letter dated XX/XX/2019 you stated that the amount was {$1800.00} and then in your letter dated XX/XX/2019 the amount was {$2100.00}. You have not sent any itemization of the alleged charges accurately totaling either amount. You have only sent a ledger of all my rent payments. FDCPA gives me the right to have itemization on what is owed and reasonable basis on why it is owed. 

( 3 ) Furthermore, to address your statement Regarding your demand for verification including original signed contracts, copies of state licenses, our agreement with the original creditor listed on this account etc., there is no basis in law to substantiate your right to such information. In fact, court cases and the Federal Trade Commission have found there is not duty to comply with excessive verification. is vague and deceptive. Please provide case citations for the statement you made on behalf of Hunter Warfield.

The above only has the violations. As both Hunter Warfield are both being vague, deceptive with the amounts I can't even begin to dispute the charges are fraudulent.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Hunter Warfield, Inc.",AZ,85210,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3355727,"33.39,-111.84"

I never applied for it, I don't have any contracts or agreements with this company. I was victim of Identity Theft, somebody stole my personal information to open credit cards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,AZ,85123,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-26,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3353844,"32.731,-111.691"

I reviewed Experian 's response, dated XX/XX/2019, and it is insufficient, as a matter of law. 

Strangely, you closed this case anyway. 

Re-read my feedback and re-open my initial complaint, BECAUSE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY COPY OF THE TWO LETTERS FROM EXPERIAN 'S GENERAL COUNSEL THAT THEIR RESPONSE RELIES ON. 

Said differently, MONETARY RELIEF IS REQUIRED. THAT IS MY POLICY.

I never applied for it, I don't have any contracts or agreements with this companies. I was victim of Identity Theft, somebody stole my personal information to open credit cards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a  consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

After my XX/XX/2019 dispute, the XXXX XXXX account was blocked from my credit report. Soon afterward, XXXX XXXX changed the account number and reinserted the fraudulent account back onto my credit report. This reinserted account had all the same account details as the previously deleted fraudulent account, just a different account number. In XXXX, 2019 I disputed the reinserted account and once again Experian deleted the fraudulent account. However once again, not too soon afterwards XXXX XXXX changed the account number and reinserted the same account back to my credit report for the third time. Each of these times I was never notified by Experian that they would be reinserting a previously deleted account to my report pursuant to section 623 of FCRA. 

Moreover, I disputed a fraudulent XXXX XXXX card. XX/XX/XXXX, 2019the results came back that the card was "" verified '' but all the inquiries were deleted. How is it that the XXXX XXXX card is "" verified '' but the inquiries are fraudulent and deleted? That makes absolutely no sense at all and seems to be Experian being willfully noncompliant and negligent.

2019-08-26,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"As advised by the CFPB, since the company failed to call me back as promised by XX/XX/2019, I am filing a new complaint. Below and attached is a summary of the communications to the company advising I did not concur and requesting company to refund me for the fees and charges since the original wire transfer on XX/XX/2019 and to reverse all negative reportings to credit agencies since the original wire transfer. The company failed to provide requested information and a new payoff statement during the XX/XX/2019 phone call and did not respond to the closing attorney 's email reqeust which included the returned wire transfer. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I received a phone call today XXXX XXXX from XXXX/Lakeview point of contact name XXXX ID # XXXX regarding the response to this complaint filed by Lakeview/XXXX  that it was considered closed and that per my email below that I did not concur. We discussed my email notification ( see attached email XX/XX/2019 ) and that I did not agree the complaint was resolved based on : the original wire transfer was sent on XX/XX/2019 and XXXX/Lakeview return of the wire transfer in the amount of {$210000.00} ( as per payoff statement requested on XX/XX/2019, issued on XX/XX/2019 and amount good through XX/XX/2019 ). The closing attorney had no knowledge the wire transfer was not accepted until it was returned on XX/XX/2019 a week after closing on the property which was on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019 the closing attorney XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX, myself and XXXX/Lakeview had a conference call with XXXX/Lakeview trying to resolve the return wire. Ms. XXXX was asked by XXXX/Lakeview to provide documentation of the return wire ( in which she provided XX/XX/2019 via email ) and promised a response to resolve this matter so we could payoff the loan. She never received a response nor received the requested fax of a new payoff statement. It was not communicated from XXXX/Lakeview that the escrow account was short in the amount of {$370.00} during the call. The only documentation we had for the payoff was the original payoff statement which was good through XX/XX/2019 ( the property settled on XX/XX/2019 and the original wire transfer was sent on XX/XX/2019 ). On XX/XX/2019 XXXX/Lakeview escrow account was short funds to pay the insurance but it was NOT until I received via in US Postal Service a hard copy of a new payoff statement received on XX/XX/2019 that I was aware of this amount due. This new payoff statement was issued XX/XX/2019. Had XXXX/Lakeview communicated the escrow shortage amount of {$370.00} at the time the wire transfer was sent on XX/XX/2019 and/or during the conference call on XX/XX/2019 we would have immediately wired the shortage. Unfortunately due to lack of response from XXXX/Lakeview and after multiple requests from both myself and the closing attorney to resolve this matter XXXX/Lakeview continued to charge interest and other fees which totaled {$210000.00} per a new payoff statement requested on XX/XX/2019. I immediately filed this complaint following my last call to XXXX/Lakeview begging to resolve this matter and was told XXXX/Lakeview would not issue a new payoff statement for wire transfer in the amount of {$210000.00} and include the escrow shortage in amount of {$370.00}. 

The overage amount I have paid is in the amount of {$600.00} and the amount I am requesting be refunded by XXXX/Lakeview to me. I continue to get notifications from credit reporting agencies that I am delinquent on this mortgage and having a negative impact on my credit score. I also requested in my complaint that XXXX/Lakeview remove all negative reporting to all credit reporting agencies they made since the original payoff wire transfer on XX/XX/2019. I was assured by XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) today that I would receive a response regarding our phone call today no later than Monday XX/XX/2019.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC",NC,28411,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3354483,"34.3,-77.79"

I never applied for it, I don't have any contracts or agreements with this companies. I was victim of Identity Theft, somebody stole my personal information to open credit cards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3354438,

2019-08-25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"We have asked for your company select portfolio servicing inc to investigate these matters and your company gives us incomplete investigation information. 


Under our homeowner bill of rights we have the right to ask for this information and you keep giving us incomplete information we demand to get complete information.

I understand that under Section 6 of RESPA you are required to acknowledge my request within 20 business days and must try to resolve the issue within 60 business days. Please treat this letter as a "" qualified written request '' under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 2605 ( e ). 

I am writing to you to complain about the accounting and servicing of my mortgage and my need for understanding and clarification of various charges, credits, debits, transactions, reversals, actions, payments, analyses and records related to the servicing of my loan from its origination to the present date. To date, the documents and information I have, that you have sent me, and the conversations with your service representatives can not answer my many questions. 
It is my understanding that your company has been accused as engaging in one or more predatory lending and servicing schemes. As a citizen, I am extremely concerned about such practices by anyone, let alone my own mortgage company or anyone who has held a beneficial interest in my QUALIFIED WRITTEN REQUEST COMPLAINT DISPUTE OF DEBT/ VALIDATION OF DEBT TILA REQUEST Page 2 of 8 loan. I am concerned that such abuses are targeting the uneducated and uninformed consumer and disadvantaged, poor, elderly and minorities. 

Needless to say, I am more concerned as an alleged borrower. I am worried that potential fraudulent and deceptive practices by unscrupulous mortgage brokers ; sales and transfers of mortgage servicing rights ; deceptive and fraudulent servicing practices to enhance balance sheets ; deceptive, abusive and fraudulent accounting tricks and practices may have negatively affected my credit rating, mortgage account and/or the debt or payments to which I am legally obligated. 
Because of this and other reasons that leave me to believe that I may be a victim of predatory lending, I am disputing the validity of the current debt you claim I owe. By debt I am referring to : 1. The principal balance claimed owed ; 2. My calculated monthly payment, 3. Calculated escrow payment 4. And any fees claimed to be owed by you or any trust or entity you may represent.

I have reason to believe that the loan terms were misrepresented to me at the time of application and further obscured and/or modified prior to signing. I believe that my income may have been inflated on the application. I also have reason to believe that certain statements were not provided for my approval prior to closing, and that signatures may have been forged on various documents. It is also my belief that certain documents may have not been presented at all. Additionally, I believe that a notary was not physically present to witness my signatures on several pertinent documents and that I was ill advised at the time of closing.

In XXXX of XXXX Northern Trusts employee XXXX XXXX informed me that my line of credit was up and not being resigned my ex husband. I made arrangements with Mr XXXX to give me an extra 8 to 10 months to sell my house which I put up immediately on the market. During this time a fake buyer was sent to me signed a contract destroyed my house in an inspection ( 10 different inspection at the same time ), now this was a fake inspection and I do have the proof, they damaged my house they never qualified and this heals me up for four months, then I had a terrible back up do to a pipe break and my house was flooded with XXXX! This was an insurance nightmare. Florida XXXX XXXX investigated me for ten months. 

I had already sold the house for {$000.00} profit {$4000.00} not XXXX but close after 34 years of paying on time every month 2 mortgage not one!

I had a credit score of over 800 as high as XXXX Within the year the Northern started tagging me as delinquent! I wouldnt have know about it if it wasnt for XXXX letting me know my score when down hundreds of points and I had my payments on automatic withdrawal. The closing or my ex husband could have stopped the pay auto but as soon as the bank let me know I had made my payments monthly at my local branch where they know me by name. 

I paid off the mortgage in full had a full closing Northern Trust turned this over to a local attorney, I told him ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), this man opened 3 different foreclosure cases at the same time!!! 

Three open foreclosures against me on the same day on the same property ( both of these men are involved with someone I know that is trying to annihilate me ).

2019-08-23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Dear CFPB, Im writing to you because my mortgage company has been playing games with me since XX/XX/2019. Almost 8 months ago I applied for a short sale with Select Portfolio Servicing and everything was going well the first 2 months of review until Select Portfolio Servicing requested a Brokers Price Opinion on my home.

The report from Select Portfolio Servicing finally came in after 4 weeks of waiting and with a big surprise I found out Select Portfolio Servicing didn't use an appraisal company to confirm the value of my home. 

I requested for a copy of the report since the amount that Select Portfolio Servicing was requesting for was over $  755,000.which that value shows several discrepancies considering the property value is only {$450000.00}. 

After reviewing the file with a manager by the name XXXX XXXX Supervisor from the consumer ombudsman dept. p. XXXX ext XXXX who advise that because the investor of this loan did not want to pay for an appraisal of review the account properly for a short sale. They had no choice to use the Brokers Price Opinion ordered. 

Also I found out that Select Portfolio Servicing MANIPULATED the report showing shows my property is based on multiple unit property with XXXX units. 
Which is completely false my property is not XXXX units, which I provided supporting documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX RECORDS AND A LICENSED APPRAISAL REPORT. 

Now XXXX XXXX Supervisor from the consumer ombudsman dept. p. XXXX ext XXXX refuses to take my call to address this issue of the fact that I have provided showing the proof this is a XXXX unit and the value that XXXX XXXX Supervisor from the consumer ombudsman dept. p. XXXX ext XXXX is wrong and false. 


Please help me since now Select Portfolio Servicing is manipulating the number of units on the value report to take advantage of me and refusing to help me avoid foreclosure even though I was already told my loan is qualified for a short sale.

2019-08-23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX myself and my wife received a mortgage loan from Citibank mortgage for the amount of $ XXXX@ 3.25 % for a fix 30 year fix loan. Loan was based on our primer status with Citibank. Since we had over {$500000.00} with Citibank, we were promised 1/8 point discount on the loan. When we were on final stages of loan preparation, we were told that since we are using part of the {$500000.00} for down payment, we were not eligible for 1/8 point discount. At that point we did not have any other options and we reluctantly closed the loan. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a check for {$4000.00} from Citibank mortgage without any explanations. As I dug into the issue, I discovered that this check was for the 1/8 point overcharge based on a XXXX XXXX dollar settlement Citibank had CFPB. The {$4000.00} check, based on the person responded to my calls with Citibank, is for the rate difference. Citibank told me that they have calculated the difference in interest for 5 years and made some deductions that is how they have arrived to {$4000.00}. I argued with the Citibank representative that this not acceptable. They need to either pay me the difference in monthly payment between 3.25 % and 3.125 %, which is equal to {$73.00} per month, for as long as I hold the loan and bring the back payments in to today 's dollar value. Alternatively, they can calculate the loan amounts that I should have had received in XXXX instead of {>= $1,000,000}. This new principal value, based on XXXX dollars, would have been {>= $1,000,000} or {$17000.00} more than what I received as principal for the loan. This XXXX should be adjusted to today 's dollar value. 
This issue was escalated and I talked to the managers. Everyone repeated the same information that I received the interest for 5 years with some subtractions. Although Citibank was always very polite, but basically their point was that this is the money you were not expecting, so go enjoy it! This response is not acceptable. I do not see any issue with my logic and reasoning. Citibank did not provided what they have advertised and they should correct their mistake and properly reimburse us.

When we arrived at the hotel in XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX XXXX, we presented the same card for incidentals. Upon checkout, on XX/XX/XXXX, we were charged and have a receipt for XXXX euro in incidentals. We continued to use the card, a chip card, for the rest of the trip. 

After returning home, we see on our XXXX statement a charge for {$7300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX. We have no idea who this is, or what the charge is for. When we reported this to XXXX, they took the charge off of our account, stopped the card, and issued a new card, and we thought all was well. 

Subsequently, we were contacted by XXXX and told that since the card remained in our possession, and that it was a chip card, that fraud was not possible, so we are liable for this charge. We have disputed this statement, since we have no idea what the charge is and did not authorize it, it is fraudulent. XXXX XXXX tells us that the merchant is in the hotel business, so there must be some connection to the hotel. 

After several go arounds with the XXXX fraud and dispute staff, including sending a letter XX/XX/XXXX recounting our story and disputing their denial of the claim, we received a call saying that they were standing by their position that no fraud occurred and that we were liable. Interest continues to accrue on this charge. 

I called them today and were told two things, that the case was closed, and that a new case was opened # XXXX to request proof from the merchant about the validity of the charge. I told them that I was planning to file a complaint with the CFPB, and they were OK with that. I was told that a manager would be getting back to me within 24-48 business hours. 

I hope that you are able to help with this matter. Its quite possible that we are not the only tourists who have been victimized in this way.

There were fraudulent ACH debits on my account on XX/XX/XXXX for {$380.00} and {$4400.00}. I was proactive about securing my account by filing a claim and speaking with both the representative and a personal banker at the branch about the best steps to secure my account while the claim is being processed. Both representatives said that I should not close the account while the investigation is pending. However, one representative said that my account should be secure if I withdraw the funds from it and keep the balance low. Both reps claimed they could block ACH debits from my savings account, but not my checking. 

However, fraud continues to build up on my account. There was another unauthorized transaction that I noticed today, XX/XX/XXXX of a transaction on XX/XX/XXXX for {$380.00} that led to my account being overdrawn. I called in again and filed another claim, but I am dissatisfied that money is allowed to be continuously drained. 

I also applied for a {$500.00} promotion that has not posted. Obviously, the fraud and account security is more important, but I would appreciate if that could be expedited since it's probably necessary that I close the account since it's compromised. 

I believe I am being proactive about securing my account but Citibank is not. My checking account should be easily blocked from all future ACH debits. Please ensure this is the case.

2019-08-22,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I obtained a loan from Mariner Finance in XXXX Tennessee. After paying on it for a little while I had a bad string of luck and got behind. They in turn placed my account with their attorney 's office ( XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX ) for suit to be filed. I contacted them and set up an arrangement, per the attorney, that if I continued to pay a set monthly payment they would continue the case so as not to obtain judgement on me. I faithfully paid for two years, missing only one payment with the permission of XXXX XXXX ( the branch manager ) due to me getting married. I paid extra the next few months to get caught up. The whole time Mariner Finance is reporting to my credit that I am current and paying on time. When I paid my XXXX payment this year I knew I was getting close to the end. Mariner had my total at {$320.00} and some change but I knew that the attorney 's amount was a bit different due to fees and court chargers. I called the attorney 's office in XXXX of this year and they informed me the TOTAL balance ( fees, court cost, and the remaining balance of the original suit ) was {$110.00}. I called Mariner back to again make sure. They said that they would balance their books to the attorney 's total because that is what is truly owed. I called the attorney 's office starting XX/XX/XXXX of this year to confirm the balance and to see how I could pay the remaining balance. For the next two weeks ; myself nor Mariner Finance ( whom I had contacted to see if they could get an answer since they would not return my calls ) could get them to answer a phone call, return a phone call, or even return an email sent by the branch manager for Mariner FinancXXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I finally was able to get a hold of the Law Firm and pay them the remaining {$110.00}. I was given a receipt showing final payment and the date of XX/XX/2019. A few days later I received a PAID IN FULL letter from the attorney 's dated XX/XX/2019, that was sent to XXXX County Court asking them to dismiss the case and that the matter was paid in full. Then the first week of XXXX I had an alert on my credit that Mariner Finance reported that I was 30 days late on a payment and that my balance was {$320.00}. My payments were due on the XXXX of each month I paid XX/XX/XXXX with the FINAL payment. That is only 13 days NOT 30!. I called and spoke with TWO managers who told me to contact the customer care line at their corporate office. I called several times and NEVER got a return call. A week later I called the XXXX Tennessee branch and was directed to the location that the area director was working out of that day. I called and spoke with the area director who explained that he was out on vacation the previous week. After speaking with him and sending him a copy of the PAID IN FULL letter he stated that he would get with the corporate office and get it taken care of and to give him two business days to get it done. That they were going to waive the "" remaining balance '' because my letter does state PAID IN FULL! Then on XX/XX/2019 I had ANOTHER late payment hit from them on my credit report showing that I am now 60 days past due! But how can I be 60 days past due when the debt has been PAID IN FULL? My credit has now dropped 55 points in two weeks and has cost me a car deal that I was working on for a new car and I can not be on the mortgage for my house that my wife and I were going to refinance. It has been a full week now, I reached out to the area director saying that this was UNACCEPTABLE, and the only response from the area director was "" I hope to reach out to you tomorrow ''.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal XXXX portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required XXXX of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the XXXX, FCRA, XXXX PRIVACY RULE, XXXX, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE  COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33027,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3351001,"25.98,-80.34"

I asked them to send me proof that it was my debt and they said it would take 5-7 business days to get the documents to me via e-mail. After a week I called them back and this time I asked for the manager and him how concerned, upset, and unfair I felt about this debt being on my credit and them still not giving me any type of proof of it or having any urgency to do so. He assured me that he could expedite the process and that he could get me something in three days. After three days nothing came. I continued to call this company day in and day out and almost daily from XX/XX/XXXX to this current day asking them to give me proof of this debt and they still continue to give me the same line about how they are waiting to get the documents from XXXX well into over two months now. There is one same lady that I have spoken with at least a dozen times in this time period that I have been calling them over and over and her name is XXXX XXXX and her number at the company is XXXX.

( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general.

( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

2019-08-22,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3350016,

The monthly fee for this type of card is {$3.00}, but if your balance is less at the time the fee is charged, they charge less. 
I had {$28.00} on my card on XX/XX/2019 ; the date the fee comes off They charged me {$4.00} and when I called to inquire about this the rep told me the fee changed XX/XX/XXXX. I stated I had not gotten anything letting me know this fee had been raised and the rep said she could not do anything about this I then went to the XXXX and looked at the FAQ 's updated XX/XX/2019 for this particular card because they have several different cards with different terms There it tells you that the fee is {$3.00}, and under the cardholders agreement, the same. It had also been updated XX/XX/2019. It further states that if they are changing the fees associated with this card, they will give written notice prior to the effective date as required per applicable law. According to FDIC.gov rules on their website, it states that the increase must be in writing and highlighted in some manner. I did not get anything from them. When I had finished my homework ; so to speak, I called back. I told them what I had found. They put me on hold to look for themselves. The floor supervisor I was speaking with came back and said that he just checked the website and it states the fee is now {$4.00}. I told him he was crazy because the website I was at said no such thing! I asked him to waive the fees. He said no. I am pretty stressed at this point in the whole darn mess. I needed that money for a bill. It is unlawful to do what they have done. Besides my not receiving written notice, it clearly states their rates are different than what they are charging and that is false advertisement, I am pretty sure.

I never applied for it, I don't have any contracts or agreements with this company. I have never sign anything. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.

I paid the amount monthly - even after my ex-husband applied for Bankruptcy and was discharged under his name ( his name still remains as a co-borrower ). 

Recently, XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my loan to XXXX XXXX, which then authorized Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) to administer the loan payments, etc. SLS appears to be more of a collection service bureau than a financial institution. 

XXXXk XXXX XXXX sold my loan on or around XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified by XXXX of the sale to XXXX XXXX and was informed that I would receive information soon from the new loan company. I did not receive ANY paperwork, information on where to pay my loan, etc. until XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter from Specialized Loan Servicing indicating that my home equity loan is now delinquent, and I needed to contact SLS to discuss possible loss mitigation options. I was able to navigate the SLS site and set up an online account. I had difficulty adjusting the payment that covered a specific time line, the site would only allow for me to make the past payment due PLUS a payment that was due in XXXX. I was able to call SLS where they were willing to take the payment that was currently due. On XX/XX/19, I logged on to make my XXXX payment - and once again, the site would not allow me to adjust the current payment due ( {$220.00} ), instead a payment of {$470.00} ( covering XXXX ) was ordered. Also, I am not able to change my method of payment. I want to use a different debit/credit care and the SLS website will not allow me to do this. 

The SLS site and XXXX XXXX company is very difficult to navigate and communicate with. When I call, and enter my phone number ID, they claim that my phone number is not identified with my account number. SLS has also marked me down as making two late payments, when that is not a fair assessment. I do plan to refinance this loan in the next few months, but I am trying to pay down other finances first in order to be eligible for a lower interest rate. Please assist. Thank you.

On XXXX of this year, the company XXXX, the company name for Shell Point Mortgage purchased my mortgage from now defunct XXXX. The only problem is that I was not informed of the change until XXXX. I received my formal welcome in XXXX after one employee did admit that there were multiple issues with the welcome letters due to the volume of now mortgages. I made my payment on time to XXXX in XXXX and proved to Shell Point with a bank receipt that I did so.Shell Point is insisting that XXXX send it back but can provide no proof that they did. Instead they are forcing me to provide multiple month statements of my bank records as if I did something wrong. I do not have anything to hide but I do believe that my privacy overrules the companies lack of evidence and acting like a bully. I am not applying for a mortgage but the company is insisting that I must provide more information. In the months that followed, My credit rating was demolished and attempts to purchase other rental properties were unsuccessful due to my new low rating. I made multiple attempts to contact XXXX XXXX with both phone calls and emails and the results were not positive. Multiple robocalls, with some on vacation even though I did not release my phone and in XXXX instance I was threatened by a by a XXXX XXXX to hold my credit rating hostage until I provide this information.I sent an email pleading that I am not a litigious person and wished to only to correct my credit rating and ask for a copy of the receipt from XXXX showing that they returned my XXXX payment. I have talked to two different lawyers that all agree that your company is treating me unfairly but that the legal costs would out-way correcting this issue.

This was a charge from XX/XX/XXXX, I had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time as I was under my father’s insurance. 	I received a few phone calls in XX/XX/XXXX from *XXXX Fraud Alert #*, I obviously did not answer. I had a voicemail saying to please call and confirm a social security number. I XXXX Eastern Connecticut and saw extremely negative reviews. My concern regarding giving them my personal information only began to grow. When I called back I instructed the representative that they showed up on my phone as fraud. Then the representative began to instruct me on an XXXX XXXX debt. I asked from when was this from, they said XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her if XXXX XXXX put my insurance in. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in and out of state number. I know that my insurance would have went through, as I had XXXX XXXX XXXX and had numerous bills that were all covered. I instructed her to reach out to the XXXX XXXX and try to submit the claim or call me back if there were any issues. I didn’t feel comfortable just making a payment to this organization, especially after the reviews and the type of infection I had during that time. When the organization never called me back, I assumed that the XXXX XXXX had taken care of it.	After I got an update from my XXXX  app on a negative report to my score, I saw it was Eastern Connecticut. I immediately called Eastern Connecticut, and left numerous Voice Mail Messages. I had one representative hang up on me multiple times, when I was trying to explain I don’t live in Connecticut. After finally getting through to one representative, I finally paid the XXXX dollars. I asked if they could send a report to your company saying they didn’t have my address and the person laughed at me over the phone. He said, “Why would I help your credit score”. He said, having a phone number is sufficient enough to report someone as a derogatory account. 	This organization is taking advantage of people and I don’t want my credit report to be negatively reflected by this. XXXX even reported their entity as fraud. I did pay this organization, however extremely reluctantly. I have attached a copy of the receipt. Please, if your organization can update my credit score and remove this derogatory account information. I have never missed a payment on any of my accounts.

2019-08-21,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in stat
ement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NJ,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3348903,

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33028,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3349104,"26.02,-80.34"

I currently hold a home loan with them! My mortgage loan was sold to them (New Rez) back in XX/XX/XXXX. Since my loan was sold to them, it’s been a total nightmare! They claimed my loan payments were late when they weren’t! And I just got with them. They have been calling and calling harassing me as if I’m not making my payments!  When I first connected with New Rez they told me when I could start making payments, which was told to me wrong when I spoke to them in XX/XX/XXXX. They told me by XX/XX/XXXX is when I could start making my payments.  Fast Forward a couple month..  I went to check my credit file, my credit file indicated that I was still with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX all the way until XX/XX/XXXX...although payment were going to Shell point.  I also was writing to Shell Point (New Rez) trying to dispute this situation several times and also behind a late payment for XX/XX/XXXX...And need I remind you, I WAS SOLD TO THEM and this is happening. I did not hear back from them at all! After making several attempts to reach out to them, I noticed they have me late again for several months when I was not! When a Loan has been sold to another loan company, consumers are entitled to protection. Mortgage companies have a legal obligation to protect consumers during loan transfers. And I felt like I was not. I did receive a letter from XXXX that my loan had been sold but when I call XXXX, they told me to give NewRez a call. I never received the Transfer notice. So I did call NewRez and that’s when they told me I had time to make arrangements but I still end up getting a late. I was in good standing with my last loan company up until I was given to NewRez (Shell Point)…I am sending copies of the payment History dates that I made payments before the 30ty day late! Oh and why I ended with making payments before a 30ty day late is because how my payments started with NewRez.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",MS,39500,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3347913,

I never applied for it,  I don't have any contracts or agreements with this companies. I believe, that I was victim of Identity Theft, somebody stole my personal information to open credit cards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of— (1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer; (2) a copy of an identity theft report; (3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and (4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. (b) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section— (1) that the information may be a result of identity theft; (2) that an identity theft report has been filed; (3) that a block has been requested under this section; and (4) of the effective dates of the block. (c) Authority to decline or rescind. (1) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that— (A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error; (B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or (C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. (2) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i (a)(5)(B) of this title. (3) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. (d) Exception for resellers. (1) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency— (A) is a reseller; (B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and (C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. (2) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if— (A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and (B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. (3) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. (e) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a (p) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. (f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30327,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3347809,"33.86,-84.42"

Our attempts include both the online process at XXXX AND 4 different phone numbers (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, XXXX-XXXX-XXXX & XXXX-XXXX-XXXX).  I do not know how I got to talk to a real live person, XXXX, but he helped me with temporarily lifting my credit freeze using the PIN provided to me by Experian at the time the freeze was put in place.  He provided me the XXXX-XXXX-XXXX number, but my wife has not been able to talk to a real live person.  Experian needs to have an option to talk to a real person as the phone options either end in a infinite loop, it hangs up, or it informs me to submit a long list of documents to mail.  The online process results in sending the long list of documents.  My wife's PIN did work at a credit union when we applied to be members on XX/XX/XXXX.  We put a credit freeze at all 3 companies in XX/XX/XXXX. We received PINs from all three.  XXXX  and XXXX online process worked perfectly.As I am filing this complaint, my wife tried one last time to temporarily lift her credit freeze online.  It worked!!!! I don't know why it did NOT work in the past. Maybe because of the credit pull the credit union did resulted in Experian's system to recognize the PIN.No person should have to go through this much effort to either freeze or lift a freeze.  ALL credit score companies should be required by law to provide an option to talk to a real person.

2019-08-20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Dear Wells Fargo involved decision makers :This is a new complaint about what I believe without a doubt I could prove that is your criminal activities using improperly my information, manipulating my information unlawfully and knowingly when reporting it to at least XXXX  Credit Bureau And  with your malicious intent to cover-up your other violations of the law against me too. Today XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  provided me with my XXXX   Credit Report Of today’s date :XX/XX/XXXX. From that same today’s date XXXX Credit Report,  I took a screenshot and attached it herein in this Complaint . The Screenshot shows a part of that above referenced XXXX credit report that indicates that the only Wells Fargo credit Account I’ve ever hard with You is in closed status from a last update of XX/XX/XXXX. Looking at the last four number were masked but the first consecutive 12 numbers of that Wells Fargo account are definitely not my Wells Fargo credit account ending in XXXX   which yourself confirmed to the CFPB that I opened in XX/XX/XXXX ( I attached a photo of my Wells Fargo credit account ending in XXXX and the photo shows the full 16 digit numbers ). The second observation is the fact that account without a doubt is the Wells Fargo account ending in XXXX  which I rejected it , disputed it and it is a fraudulent account in violation of your own consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC and of course in violations of many other laws and/or statutes and/or regulations and/or legal Acts...etc  (sorry that you got caught up again of illegal activities against my person in retaliation for my protected activists Against your fraud and more). The evidence shows now that you closed account ending in XXXX not on XX/XX/XXXX as you alleged falsely and knowingly to the CFPB in your recent statement which I attached the full copy of it . You lied . You cheated again. You did worse and I have proofs of that worse and all privileged.I understand that it was not a coincidence. I understand that it was not the only time you falsified against the real factual information that is related to my person and that affects my person extremely and you know that!! I understand that you think now that is all I found out about your fraud against my person . No there are lot of surprises when you are facing charges against you at any time at a federal district court in front juries and to hold you legally and criminally accountable for many of your violations against me . I reserved the right to sue you on that and other at any time without any type of a notice but the summon of a charge been filed against you and that can be at any time . You are forcing me to an Endless number of legitimate complaints against you and that is causing me emotional distress , social isolation  and fear from what is the next and new crime you might be plotting against me to silence me for good .  I consent only to the CFPB to pull my today’s full XXXX Credit report and I also have a copy of it which  I will send it electronically to the CFPB Enforcement and I am looking forward to the day that they will stop you from harming me .Please please stop  your reckless cover up scam against my person . You are invading my privacy recklessly and it is proven now as part of your criminal activities against me.Please stop your retaliation and your cover up methods are disturbing and shows the level of ignorance as it appears over and over . Your several harassing letters whether those you shared with the CFPB or those you hide from the CFPB and I will use all of it against you in court . Opening Closing  reopening account on my name illegally to adapt your answers to my complaints against your violations you did , is not going to hide the facts . Be assured of that .no one is above the law . I will always follow role of law to hold you accountable for all your illegal activities and other unlawful violations you did against me.God is Great ,remember this one .I told you before that the public , the constitution and God is protecting me from your crimes . You should take that seriously for your own good . Without waiving my rights , all stated herein is to my current state’s belief ,knowledge and understanding and it is all subject to any correction or change of any type and at any time by my person or my representative and without waiving my rights .Conclusion :Wells Fargo involved decision makers in the scam, fraud and unlawful activities against me proved again my allegations against them are facts proven. you cannot change those facts and the more cover up you are engaging in against my rights , the more irreparable  damages and losses you are causing against my person which even XXXX XXXX dollars cannot satisfy . Would that amount satisfy your destroying of my life that can never be the same good before you destroyed it !??!! Be ready for accountability . You have no where to hide and if you resign you will still be charged in court and held accountable for your illegal activities and/or crimes against me .Pardon me on any misspelling if it existed herein and I apologize.

I implore you to review the inconsistencies within your internal emailing system and the misstatements given by your managing account specialists. Moreover, I would like to bring your attention to two phone conversations held with federal loan specialists, in which the first agent provided contradictory information to that of the 2nd representative.Initial call took place on XX/XX/2019at proximately XXXX XXXX. Please track sequence and review this call. Within this call, the representative scoffed at me to imply that I was lying about ever submitting a deferment.  The federal loan account specialist confirmed with upmost certainty that there was absolutely no record of Any deferment documents in her system. Her condescending tone was quite discouraging therefore, I allowed her to terminate the callWithout resolve. She advised, as you will hear from the recording, that without a confirmation email, no receipt could be verified. Later that evening, I called and advised that I would record the call for quality assurance. The call had to be transferred . XXXX  (XXXX sequence number) was gracious enough to review file. After searching multiple times, she was able to confirm my deferment documents. This leads me to believe that when the deferment was confirmed over the phone previously , that the file was mishandled, file was not denoted and I, misinformed. This has caused a great deal of emotional distress upon me. I have pleaded for assistance but, instead I’ve been ignored and bullied by the federal loan team. I have attached phone records for your reference so that you may locate calls and I have printed both confirmation emails.This is my last attempt to resolve amicably.If not able to resolve, I will retain counsel to litigate these matters. Please be advised that a copy of this letter and supporting documents will be provided to credit bureaus.

2019-08-19,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Signed up for the Amazon Credit Card as they heavily advertise it. Upon being approved for the card they allowed me to start using it before the card was physically mailed to my house. Unfortunately, you can not signup for auto-bill pay or register an account with the website until the card physically arrives at my doorstep. 

No problem, a few weeks later it arrives, I create a login on the website and immediately sign up for Automatic Bill Payment. This is done successfully and I quadruple check that my payments pay off the full balance ( not just minimum ) during each statement ( like I do with all my accounts ). 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I found out my payments were being declined. The Synchrony Banking websites are all broken, and all seem to take you to different portals so I called the 800 number. They confirmed that I signed up for auto-pay but they said "" some '' payments ( especially the first ) will not always be automatically billed and need to be manually submitted. Thus, my first payment was never actually paid, and my account is now "" delinquent '' and fees + interest accrued. 

It took a lot of time but I was able to pay the balance, get the fees + interest reversed and close the card, however, this is not enough. Their billing practices and customer support are highly suspicious, asking multiple times ( on the same phone call ) for sensitive PII even after I had given it through the automated system AND to the representative on the phone. Additionally, I have never heard of an account not allowing automatic-bill pay in such an inconsistent manner. This should be fixed and should be in massive letters when signing up for auto bill pay that it doesn't work as the customer might imagine.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,CA,94112,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-21,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3346601,"37.72,-122.44"

She advised me that since I was refusing to pay....I advised her per my letter to IQ at no time was I refusing to pay my bill, I am refusing to pay the amount because it is not accurate. I asked to speak to a manager. XXXX came on the line pretending to be a manager. XXXX advised me there was no investigation going on it wasn't ever returned to the apartment complex for an adjustment and I would pay the XXXX if that's what I wanted but the account wouldn't be considered paid off. He then said let me get you to a manager because I don't like the way this call is going. And put me on hold. In comes XXXX XXXX. XXXX regurgitated the same things her coworkers said. At this point in frustration I yelled out as she kept talking over me!! These employees and this company are disgraceful!!! I have never experienced such rudeness and disrespect or lack of assistance in getting this matter handled. If I don't owe the amount, all they have to do is bring it back to the apartment complex for an adjustment and I would pay the final bill, which I still intent to do on the XX/XX/XXXX.

Briefly, I bought ~$XXXX  worth of items from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and used my CBNA/HD card ending in XXXX to pay for it.  They sent me statements by email instead of snail mail (which has ALWAYS been my preferred delivery choice and have NEVER changed it) so I missed the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX statements, which I was expecting by mail.  I rarely check email which is why I ALWAYS have bills sent by mail. I only found out about it because I got a red flag email from XXXX XXXX that I had a 30 days late note on my credit report from this card.  I called CBNA/HD customer service immediately to pay the bill and the rep even reversed one of the late fees for me but did say that I had to call the credit reporting agencies to dispute the mistake.  This was deleted, then reinserted by CBNA, then deleted again in XX/XX/XXXX after the first of my 3 disputes, then reinserted again by CBNA.  I sent a certified letter to CBNA explaining the above in detail but all I got in return was yet another robotic response that the ""information was correct and they weren't going to change it""...This has deflated my otherwise good credit score to the extent that I'm unable to refinance my house which has enough equity in it to pay off my credit card and home equity loan debts.

I never applied for it,  I don't have any contracts or agreements with this companies.I have never sign anything.  I was victim of Identity Theft, somebody stole my personal information to open credit cards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of— (1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer; (2) a copy of an identity theft report; (3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and (4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. (b) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section— (1) that the information may be a result of identity theft; (2) that an identity theft report has been filed; (3) that a block has been requested under this section; and (4) of the effective dates of the block. (c) Authority to decline or rescind. (1) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that— (A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error; (B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or (C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. (2) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i (a)(5)(B) of this title. (3) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. (d) Exception for resellers. (1) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency— (A) is a reseller; (B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and (C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. (2) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if— (A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and (B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. (3) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

Once I called the bank and put up a fuss about it , they told me that it’ll take 2 hours to release the funds. Unfortunately, they requested that I put in a dispute to release my funds. What brought me to this site today was that my bank told me that funds in the amount of $XXXX had “disappeared” and should’ve been in my account. I spoke to 4 different customer service representatives who all gave me a different story on why I didn’t receive funds that I so desperately needed . On one occasion I found where the money was missing and the bank had to do an investigation and replenished the money that “disappeared”. So this is not the first time for losing money that should reflect in the system.I would like to have an investigation into Citi Bank accounts in general. I’m sure I’m not the only person that this is happening  to. The bottom line is that Citi Bank claims that once the deposit disappears (that’s their term) that there needs to be an investigation on why the money disappeared and I have to wait 10 days for a provisional credit for money that belongs to me but clearly visible to the bank on their end. One customer service rep said that, “it’s not released wait 2hrs” , another says,”their not sure why it’s not showing on the account.

However, the next day (XX/XX/19) it was requested that I write an email to loan officer falsifying that I had been offered same interest rate by competing bank in an effort to justify Bank of America extending and confirming their offer the day prior (XX/XX/19). This request was unethical as there had been no discussion about said competing bank offering the interest rate. When questioned about the request, the loan officer implied that this would be the only way I could get my desired interest rate and continue in my application process. When the loan officer was questioned about the previously discussed and confirmed interest rate from afternoon before (XX/XX/19) it was then discovered that in fact the rate had not been locked in and it would only be locked in if the email was submitted in writing for his records. This represented a very compromising position as I was in escrow and didn’t have much time to waste. However, I refused to falsify records for the sake of protecting the loan officer from the judgment of his colleagues and the leaders of mortgage sector of BOA. I requested that the bank honor the offer that was extended onXX/XX/19 but this request could not be granted. As a result of this unethical practice I ended my mortgage application with Bank of America and had to find another lender during the escrow process. It is unfortunate if this represents a common practice by banks to compete for business by requesting potential customers go on record with a lie to protect their officers.

I believe, that somebody used my personal information and tried to apply for credit. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of— (1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer; (2) a copy of an identity theft report; (3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and (4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. (b) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section— (1) that the information may be a result of identity theft; (2) that an identity theft report has been filed; (3) that a block has been requested under this section; and (4) of the effective dates of the block. (c) Authority to decline or rescind. (1) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that— (A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error; (B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or (C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. (2) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i (a)(5)(B) of this title. (3) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. (d) Exception for resellers. (1) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency— (A) is a reseller; (B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and (C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. (2) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if— (A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and (B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. (3) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. (e) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a (p) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. (f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NC,28226,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3344737,"35.11,-80.83"

2019-08-18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Earlier this year, my wife and I tried to log into our Citi Card app, at which time were prompted to accept the terms of use in order to log into the account.  What we didn't know at the time we accepted the terms of use, was that we agreed to paperless billing.  This was not disclosed to us at the time, and we have never had paperless billing, since 2008 when we signed up for the card.  Two months later we received a letter that our credit score had changed, which was a surprise to us, because we have always had close to 780-790 credit scores.  When we called Citi to ask about this letter, we were then told that we had not paid the previous 2 months bill.  We explained that we never received a bill in the mail, at which time they disclosed to us that we elected for paperless billing when we accepted the terms of use, ""because is it what most people do now a days"".  Our balance at the time we got the letter was $XXXX, I could have paid the balance the first month, but did not realize that we had elected unbenost to use paperless billing.  I sent a letter explain the circumstance to Citi, and they basically said tough luck, no one in the call center could help me at all after multiple calls and the only way they said I could get an answer was via letter.  After I sent the letter, they sent me back 3 different letters, saying that they understood I no longer wished to dispute the credit reporting. I never expressed that in my letter and again could not get a single representative to help me in this process.  I did not mind paying the balance, but the negative credit reporting that Citi did has greatly impacted my wife and I ability to refinance our mortgage, and again I am not getting any help from Citi Cards in the matter.  Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated,Regards,XXXX and XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3345471,

I agreed paid both in full right there and requested 1 be cancelled and I would just keep the 1 card in total.  So they took my payments reassuring me they would be marked on time for the time I was in the hospital. Canceled the 1 card due to my request.  3 years later the other card is still restricted And they never marked either one paid on time like they had agreed . I have disputed this probably 10 to 15 times over the last 3 years I have called them multiple times over and over asking for supervisors writing letters and no one is holding up What I was told.

This is not enough to validate the debt that they are trying to collect, I don’t want a piece of paper showing an itemization neither. I looked up the debt collection laws in the state of Massachusetts because that is where I reside and it says that on XX/XX/XXXX the Massachusetts Attorney general published onerous new consumer debt collection practice regulations, deeming their violation to be an unfair trade practice. It also says that these regulations, which became effective upon publication, purport to govern every business and person nationwide who engages in collecting a consumer debt (defined as any debt resulting from a purchase, lease or loan of goods, services or real or personal property or for a loan of money obtained for personal, family or household purposes, whether or not reduced to a judgement) from a person located within Massachusetts. Like I said at the beginning of my complaint, ENHANCED RECOVERY COMPANY is not willing to provide me with all documents or an original contract that bears my signature that is required in the state of Massachusetts. I am including some pictures that were taken by me so that ENHANCED RECOVERY COMPANY can read what the laws and regulations are in the state where I reside. If they are licensed to collect in Massachusetts, they should know these laws and regulations. This is not a refusal to pay, but I need this debt to be validated before I make any type of payment.

I believe I filed a complaint 3 to 4 months ago regarding an insurance issue that I couldn't resolve with this bank.  What is happening now, is that I have requested more money for my rebuild and they won't give to me until 55% of the rebuild is complete.  Mind you the amount for the rebuild is now $XXXX, way more than I paid for the house. All the prices have sky rocketed because so many people have to rebuild. Flagstar only has Less than 50% of what I need. My insurance company will not give me the balance of my money, which is XXXX, until the money is exhausted from the restricted escrow account at Flagstar. I am involved in the XXXX lawsuit and how to have more funds to finish my house, but at some point I might have to hold back on the finishing items until I have all the funds.  I will continue to pay my mortgage, as I have done.  What's upsetting is now I have all these people working at my house, have signed a contract, and will have not money to continue. Instead I will have liens on the property because I won't be able to pay anyone. The fire destroyed so much of my life, and the support and help I have gotten from Flagstar and my Insurance is causing me so much stress and anguish that I don't know what to do.  Please help me.  I am working three jobs so I can cover the extra costs, but it I can't complete the framing part, I am screwed.

2019-08-17,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"XXXX, XXXX and Transunion continue to disregard the Federal Laws for Identity Theft. I am personally filing this complaint to you and this is not a credit repair company. a) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of— (1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer; (2) a copy of an identity theft report; (3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and (4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. (b) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section— (1) that the information may be a result of identity theft; (2) that an identity theft report has been filed; (3) that a block has been requested under this section; and (4) of the effective dates of the block. (c) Authority to decline or rescind. (1) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that— (A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error; (B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or (C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. (2) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i (a)(5)(B) of this title. (3) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. (d) Exception for resellers. (1) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency— (A) is a reseller; (B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and (C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. (2) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if— (A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and (B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. (3) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. (e) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a (p) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. (f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33920,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3345524,"26.72,-81.66"

I transferred the cash from the two accounts into a new Citibank Accelerate Savings with a higher APY. For some reason, one of my accounts was not closed. When I logged into mobile banking today, I noticed that the account balance was -$XXXX. It's so unfair that they charge me a fee for an account that I requested to be closed and that was at a $XXXX balance. When I called to get the account closed again today (XX/XX/19) the representative informed me that the charge is still pending and can't be either investigated or reversed until it's posted to my account, so I'd have to call back in tomorrow. When I asked them if they could just post it, she declined and offered the same solution. I'm extremely frustrated that 1) I've attempted to close an account and that it never happened. 2) I was charged a fee that brought my account balance negative.3) That the representative couldn't refund me $XXXX for their error.4) That I'd have to call back in to get the fee reversed.

I have attached all the documents that I kept track of during the process of this project. I will be brief as I can with what has happened.. 
.Lowes was hired to do my kitchen project. I had to pay all money upfront, which I should have never agreed on, but that was their terms. I had faith in such a large company to compete this project professionally. Also, on their terms, they voided their contract after not completing the project in 3 months. I actually took them 37 weeks to get it done to the point it was functional. Lowes messed up all my flooring. They installed the wrong tiles in some places. They removed of it and replaced it. The contractor did not replace it correctly and I had issues with the tiles cracking, all the grout coming out. There were other issues causing problems as you will read below. Their project manager never came back to oversee the project, I requested he not come back and they bring in someone new. No one never came. Their contractor walked off the job holding material, which I ended up having to manage to tell a new contractor what was needed. Lowes didnt even know what to do. 
I stayed home to work for many, many days when I was expecting for a contractor to come. I even kept track of the days I was home and my own hourly rate. I have attached this as well. 
So after many conversations with Lowes, they kept saying to me that they will not settle or fix anything until they were able to get things in the kitchen done. Well, they ignored the issues with the floors and they kept telling me that we can discuss that after. Repeatedly I kept hearing the same thing. So when the contractor was done with kitchen part, they offered me a {$500.00} gift card. Never offering to fix the flooring issues. Then I filed my first dispute with Synchrony Bank refusing and stopped paying on the card. Lowes offered me {$8900.00} dollars back to give me a credit for my floor. Ok, I said I accept that, but that still doesnt resolve the issues that were caused by your mistakes, you are only giving me back what I paid for. I received a check for {$8000.00} not what they originally told me. I again said that this was still only a credit. I filled repeated disputes with Synchrony Bank about this issue. Lowes would not cover anything with their warranty. They told me that once I cashed that check that they would stop negotiating with me. First off, there was no signed letter stating this. I never agreed to anything like that and for them to sneak that in is tricky and unprofessional. 
I filed a report with the better business bureau. I priced up what it would cost for my floors to actually be corrected, which would be over {$20000.00}. I had to glue and support the damaged flooring they installed and would not repair. I had to raise my floors in other parts of my house just to make it flush. This had to be done because you couldnt rip out the floors, which Lowes would not do. 
So after the XXXX complaint, and multiple complaints, I received a letter from Synchrony Bank stating that Lowes has already agreed to settle for an additional {$12000.00} with me ( This letter is attached as well ). This was all I wanted, and was happy. This would have paid off the balance and taken care of the issues I have to redo myself. I waited, and waited no check. I called and followed up and no one has any clue as to where this money is. So, Lowes, completely lied to me, to Synchrony Bank about what they did. So, I refuse to this day to pay another dime to this account. It should have been taken care of. 

Today, I received an affidavit via email from the fraud team. I never filed a fraud claim, and do not accept responsibility for the charges due to the voided terms and conditions on Lowes contract that was breached. Lowes stated they were sending {$12000.00} credit. Where is it? I am one person again this Billion dollar company, and they cant even get their story straight and have never accepted responsibility for these mistakes. 

Synchrony bank since then has been damaging my credit due to this issue. They closed all of my other accounts I had with them because of this. They said once it was resolved, they would fix it.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,PA,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3343940,

2019-08-16,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XXXX XXXX, I made a purchase from XXXX XXXX Jewelry in XXXX XXXX, NV, of a wedding band that was to be made to fit with my engagement ring. The jeweler 's representative talked me into signing up for deferred interest financing of the purchase, which under normal circumstances would be fine, however this was not a normal transaction. Within 72 hours, I contacted the jeweler 's representative and asked to her to cancel this the wedding band, as it was determined by my husband and myself that purchasing both rings at one time would be too expensive. 

The jeweler claimed they could not cancel the purchase, that it was special order. However, the wedding band would be required to be made AFTER the engagement ring so it could fit properly next to and under the engagement ring. I insisted the order be cancelled and reiterated that cancelling at that point, less than 3 days after the purchase, would not cause the jeweler any harm as there is no way the ring had been started since it would not occur for at least 21-30 days from the time of purchase to allow time for the engagement ring to be made. They continued with the process of making the engagement ring and ignored our future requests to cancel the wedding band. I made multiple attempts to contact the owner of the company to discuss the matter, however we were always told he was out of town. It wasn't until we left a negative online review of our purchase that the owner decided to send a threatening email which stated he would have his attorney file libel charges for making false allegations against him online. 

The jeweler took over 90 days to make the engagement ring, and despite insisting multiple times to cancel the wedding band, they stated they made it anyway. However, the engagement ring was sent but we never received the unwanted and cancelled wedding band order, DESPITE BEING CHARGED IN FULL FOR BOTH. 

The jeweler charged us IN FULL, for BOTH rings on the date of purchase, which had a 12 month deferred interest promotion. We have disputed the wedding band portion of the purchase several times with Synchrony Financial, the credit card issuer, and each time they NEVER contacted me despite providing them with proof of cancellation request shortly after purchase. The issuer also continued to count the time during dispute as part of the 12 months of the special promotion period, even though we fully dispute the purchase. 

We have even gone so far as to travel all the way from our home in Florida all the way back to XXXX XXXX to resolve the issue, however the owner refuses to give us equal compensation for the wedding band purchase. We have gone above and beyond in attempts to resolve this, yet the credit issuer, Synchrony, refuses to protect us as consumers, from an unscrupulous Jeweler. Its been 15 months and we are still being charged for an item we did not want, do not have, and now we have been charged deferred interest on the purchase by Synchrony Financial. This is just not right, we deserve to have rights when making purchases.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,FL,34114,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-16,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3343474,"26.0,-81.5"

2019-08-15,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"i went to Navy Federal Credit union XXXX XXXX branch, and with XXXX i applied for a VA refinance loan on or about XX/XX/19, was told someone from their mortgage company would contact me soon, i got an email from XXXX XXXX, mortgage processor, to start the process, he uploaded some documents, but he was not avail for me to ask questions, i stopped at the branch, XXXX got XXXX on her phone and i spoke with him, set up time for him to go over the forms with me, we did, but what he kept doing was sending me forms or loan estimates just before he left the office and i could not question him about them. Right away i sent him contact info for the XXXX county first home buyer program because they have the second lien on my home of {$9000.00}, also sent him contact info for XXXX, who qualified me financially to buy this house. XXXX told me from the start i could roll my funding fee, orgination fee, and closing costs into my loan, his boss, XXXX and XXXX told me as they saw things i was bringing {$60.00} to closing. Well things changed as we went along, all of a sudden i was told by XXXX that they would not roll my appraisal into the loan, because what if the appraisal came in low and i back out of the deal, they can't take that chance, so i had to pay it up front, also XXXX said i had to unlock my credit report with XXXX, so he called them, we were on a three way, and the man from XXXX, said i had to pay {$10.00} to unlock my credit report, i did not want to because i was not the reason it was frozen, it was because they was hacked, and that said for security purpose i should lock it but could unlock as i needed to. I gave this male my credit card info, and later learned he had charged me {$10.00}, i am trying to get my monies back. After i paid for the appraisal is when XXXX started saying my money to bring to closing was {$2700.00}, i was not happy, went from {$60.00} top {$2700.00}. and his explanation i did not believe. i called the Navy branch and spoke with someone there and told them i was not happy, and XXXX XXXX boss XXXX was no help, i was frustrated. so they had XXXX XXXX boss to contact me, XXXX, she said at first my closing costs was down to {$1100.00} might go lower, then i asked about the termite inspection, she said get it done, so i scheduled it. She started talking about subordinate papers had to be done and the title company will do that so NAVY federal is the first lien and XXXX County the second lien, and she was talking more to XXXX XXXX at XXXX county, XXXX for some reason quoted the amount of my account as {$71000.00}. not {$9000.00}, so XXXX then started telling me last week that she had to roll my second mortgage into my first mortgage because thats what the V.A. requried and so my monies to bring to closing is now {$4500.00} or more, i was upset i called the V.A to ask them and XXXX XXXX said they do not require that only thing is to have the subordinate paper drawed up, went back to XXXX, then she said regardless i will still have to bring that monies to the table, then she started telling untruths about my conversation with her, as if i was asking to have the second mortgage rolled in, then i asked her about me getting a line of credit to pay off {$4000.00} of the {$9000.00}, she said if you do that you can't tell me about it, i said well forget it. I am upfront with all i do. So she sent me a email that showed my first lien lot lower but my closing costs at {$4500.00} up to {$7500.00} if i went conventional. My question was why didn't XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, led me down this road to closing and just last week say i had to bring almost {$4500.00} or more to the table. i ask her if i had to drop out of the loan what happens to the monies i have put out she said she might could get me {$200.00} refund at the most. Earlier in this process again after i paid for the appraisal, is when XXXX told me my closing costs was about {$2700.00}. and i needed to show him where i had the money to bring to closing or my application process would sit until i could produce that info. Right after i started talking to XXXX, and she redid the figures and said my closing costs was more like {$1100.00} and maybe go lower, that evening XXXX once again sent me papers via the secure system right before he went home, i thought it was XXXX that did it so i sent her a email and told her i thought that was not ever good customer service, the next day she said it was XXXX not her. Then XXXX from XXXX County last saturday sent me a email about me having a third lien on my house, but didn't explain, and she left, so she didn't answer my questions. she had a ax to grind with me because she told me and XXXX, that her paperwork would take 6 to 8 weeks for completion and then the board of chosen freeholders might not approve it then. so of course she was not available to explain, so i forwarded that email to the board of chosen freeholders because XXXX one day said to me why are you in a rush XXXX said her part would take 6 to 8 weeks. i am retired i live on a fixed amount monthly a very strict budget, and i can say right now if either one of these people from Navy Federal had told me it would cost me {$4500.00} to bring to closing i would have never gone with this application. XXXX did say during one of our conversations that Navy Federal is not doing this refinance for free, but never said how much it would cost, because that was when he was saying i was bringing {$60.00} to closing.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NJ,No00,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2019-08-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3342418,

2019-08-15,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On the evening of XX/XX/2019, I was in my apartment when I received an email from Bank of America stating that suspicious activity was detected on my Visa card. It showed a declined transaction of {$650.00} at "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and an approved transaction at the same store for {$420.00}. I selected the embedded email link that stated "" No, I don't recognize one or more of these transactions '' and called Bank of America to file a fraud claim. 

When I spoke to a customer service representative, they told me two other fraudulent transactions had been approved on my card -- each transaction was for {$100.00} at "" BP # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. The fraudulent charges made before Bank of America shut down my card thus totaled {$620.00}. 

I was asked if I or anyone from my household could have made those charges. I assured them that was not the case -- my partner and I were both in the apartment that evening when the fraud alert email arrived. I told the service rep that I have never been to either of these establishments before. I also checked to make sure that the card was still in my possession -- it was -- and told the service representative. A fraud investigation was opened and the charges were removed from my account. 

On XX/XX/2019 I received a voicemail from the fraud department asking me to call them back. I returned the call and was told my fraud claim had been denied because the chip had been used at the stores in question. I reiterated that I had possession of my card at the time of the charges, so this was impossible. They offered no proof that the chip had been used, but re-opened the case on appeal. They also put the charges back on my account. I received a letter soon after re-stating the reason that the claim was denied. 

As a Bank of America customer of 12 years who has always paid my bills on time, I feel I am not receiving a swift or appropriate response to this fraud. I therefore filed a police report the next day -- XXXX XX/XX/2019 -- explaining that my card could not have been used for these charges as it was in my wallet at the time. On XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America and asked them to add the police report to my case -- they added the case number ( # XXXX ) and gave me a fax number to submit the full report ( fax : XXXX XXXX which I immediately did. I also pointed out in the cover letter that clearly "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' had some level of awareness that the transaction was fraudulent having denied the initial charge of {$650.00}, before approving the charge of {$420.00}. 

I think it is also highly suspicious that this fraud occurred on a card that had been mailed to me very recently -- I received an alert in my online account that "" A new card is on the way '' on XX/XX/2019 and the fraud occurred 12 days later. 

On XXXX, XX/XX/2019 I received an email stating a different credit card of mine ( a XXXX card ) had been used to buy groceries at a XXXX in Georgia ( I am in XXXX XXXX ). While this may be coincidence, it seems like there has been some sort of security breach to my financial information, and so I have locked my other credit and debit cards where possible ( my credit reports were already frozen ), changed all my passwords, and am following up with that fraud claim with XXXX. I alerted Bank of America to this new credit card fraud on Wednesday, XX/XX/2019. 

I would like Bank of America to immediately remove the fraudulent charges totaling {$620.00} from my account before any interest or fees accrue, and approve the fraud claim in total. As a loyal, long-term customer I feel that Bank of America has not responded swiftly or effectively, and this entire ordeal has caused me to consider rescinding my business.

On XX/XX/2019, XXXX informed me that I would receive my method of verification into my erroneous bankruptcy information that they are reporting within XXXX days. XXXX admitted to illegally using my social security number without my authorization to obtain certain information. XXXX has also claimed that certain divisions of their company are not considered actual CRAs. Please see the details listed below. 

1. The FCRA only allows 5 days for this request. XXXX is therefore in violation of federal law. Reference : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) 2. The request still has not been fulfilled as of XX/XX/2019. XXXX is once again in violation of federal law. Reference : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) 3. In a previous correspondence with  the CFPB and myself, XXXX admitted to using my whole social security number to allegedly access files about me in the PACER system. XXXX gave a vague description of where they obtained my social security number and furthermore, was never given my permission to use my social security number as I had no business or contract with XXXX. This is also in violation of federal identity theft laws. 

4. XXXX has stated in the previous CFPB complaint reply that their division that gathers public records is not a CRA, and therefore is not subject to the FCRA laws.

I told her that i see my account in the negative and she said yes she see that which is weird. She put me on hold and called the fraud dept to see why my account was closed for fraud. They would not speak to me and they told her that my account had fraud activity. I eventually spoke to a rep from claims, customer service and the risk depart. The risk department told me that my account is froze and will be closed in 48 hours for invalid deposit. I asked what does that mean and why is my account being closed because the atm was experiencing issues. the rep told me that they have a monitoring company who checked and that my son committed fraud and did not deposit no money at all in the account and thats why my account is in the negative and I will not get my money back. Nobody could explain how any of this was verified they said they were not going to the atm to check the tape or look at the cameras because it was a fraudulent deposit.

2019-08-15,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"I first disputed the bankruptcy online with all three credit reporting agencies XXXX, Transunion and XXXX with no result. Back in XX/XX/XXXXof 2019 I sent out a letter disputing a bankruptcy that showed up on my credit report. I sent a consumer statement as well as court documents stating no information was shared with the credit reporting agency. 
In mid XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letters from XXXX, XXXX and Transunion stating they had verified this bankruptcy information with a third party XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  stated XX/XX/2019. I contact XXXX by phone and requested an inquiry report to see if in fact verified that information. I received the XXXX report 2 weeks later. There was no inquiry from XXXX on that day. On XX/XX/XXXX i sent, by certified mail, a letter in XXXX and XXXX requesting the deletion of the bankruptcy because the verification was not completed. I included all information sent previously, which included the initial dispute letter, copies of my ID and SSN, the pack of all inquiries made to XXXX XXXX in 2019 and another request for removal with the 15 day FCRA information regarding re-investigations. XXXX  sent a letter stating the ID information was too dark and could not be used, however this was 45 days later. On XX/XX/XXXX, i sent out a new letter with new ids and energy bills to XXXX  and XXXX, which XXXX   received on XX/XX/XXXX. Since i hadn't heard from them nor seen the deletion i decided to call. 

I had yet to hear from transunion. I sent them a failure to respond letter demanding deletion. I also called, the rep stated they didn't receive my certified letter which i showed they did using the usps track number. I then received a non descriptive explanation of how they verify information in general but not specifically to my affair. So I sent a final letter on XX/XX/2019 certified. 

On XX/XX/2019, i called and Spoke with XXXX  at XXXX, she stated that she could not tell me when they received my letter but to wait 30 days. I told her the Letter was received XX/XX/XXXX per the tracking number. I asked her why XXXX  Still has not removed bankruptcy since they were now In violation of fair credit reporting act Description of re investigation procedure. A consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer a description referred to in paragraph ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) by  not later than 15 days after receiving a request from the consumer for that description. She stated that because there was no consumer statement from the online request that XXXX could not delete this information. I asked for a supervisor. Supervisor = XXXX. He refused to honor my request because of the IDs. I asked why they couldn't use the IDs I had previously sent and he had no answer. 
Reasons why they havent removed bk No consumer statement Ids too dark even though previous IDs were just fine Stated he could not  remove bk without court documents Stated courts needed to verify bk They did go over time but was still unable to remove bankruptcy I asked what type of documents from the court were needed he did not answer Before hanging up on me I asked him can they prove this bankruptcy was mine and listed on my report accurately and he stated only i can tell him if it was correct. never did he once state that the information was proven to be accurate.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",OH,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3342766,

This has cost me over {$2000.00}. I have sent emails and phone calls still to no avail.

I feel as though they are playing with my finances and my credit by not closing the file they had pulled with the FHA after numerous calls and emails and a form of retaliation because I chose a different mortgage company to do my streamline refinance. 
please help me to get this resolved. I hope they are not doing this to other people.

2019-08-15,Debt collection,Other debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"Recently I moved and my old apartment turned my final bill of {$230.00} over to the collection agency IQ Data International , Inc. without my knowledge or any prior communication. On XX/XX/19 I revived a call from IQ Data International attempting to collect on this debt which was not known to me at the time. I repeated asked for some sort of proof of legitimacy via email to support the claim that I owed money fearing that it may or may not be a scam. The initial person I spoke with repeatedly refused to do any such thing. At that time I asked to advance the call to her supervisor so that I might be able to ascertain whether or not it was a scam. Upon speaking to her supervisor, a man by the name of XXXX XXXX who identified himself as an Operations Manager, Took over the call and begin to repeatedly threatened me that unless I paid in full he would not send me any kind of email with a breakdown of what was owed and for what reason. In addition he repeatedly threatened that my credit score would be severely damaged if I did not settle the matter with him on that very phone call and that I would never be able to buy a house, car, or boat. I repeatedly told Mr. XXXX that I was caught off guard by a sudden collections call and that I had no issue paying it provided that he could provide some proof of the legitimacy of the claim. Eventually, after receiving abusive language from by Mr. XXXX, I told him I had my credit card in hand ready to pay if he could honor my original request for an email breakdown of what was owed and stating to him that I had a right to know what debts were being collected for what purpose and for that information to be placed in writing. At that time Mr. XXXX repeatedly demanded my credit card information be given to him and that he would not give me an email because I was a waste of his time and that he did not feel like giving the effort. Following this exchange I asked that the call be forwarded to Mr. XXXX supervisor stating that he was not giving me adequate information and therefore I did not feel comfortable turning over any personal information. He absolutely refused to forward my call and threatened to simply hang up and file the call as a refusal to pay and again that I was a waste of time. During the phone call I heard an excessive amount of noise in the background consisting of people yelling and talking indicating that he was in a very public location. I asked him if he could move to somewhere where I could hear him more clearly to which he say thats just how me do business. Again, Mr. XXXX threatens to hang up on me and file the collections attempt as a refusal to pay. I asked him not to hang up and stated clearly that I was not refusing to pay but simply asking for one iota of proof that this collections attempt was legitimate at that time Mr. XXXX rattled off an excessive amount of my personal information including my Social Security number and my fathers name all while I could hear people in the background yelling and what sounded like cheering. After I stated that he had violated my privacy by reading outloud my personal information in what was a public setting, he agreed to email me a ledger of what was owed and for what reason provided I stay on the phone with him while I checked my email. I did receive an email and it did appear to be legitimate therefore I proceeded paid in full. However, IQ Data international Inc. in an attempt to collect a debt resisted to disclose pertinent information about the debt, subjected me to abusive language, threatened me and my future, and violated my privacy.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"I.Q.

We were approved for the 1st time in XX/XX/2019 with the 1st payment being for XX/XX/2019. We made arrangements with M & T Bank for our 1st payment to be withdrawn from our checking account on XX/XX/2019. I was NOT aware that the bank where our checking account is located ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) held/froze our available funds without our explicit knowledge ( or approval ) on the same day our M & T mortgage modification trial payment was scheduled to be withdrawn ; therefore, the mortgage modification trial payment was denied by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX where our checking account is location. We did not receive any information that our checking account 's funds were frozen until 7 business days later. By that time, the mortgage modification trial payment was declined by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. M & T Bank proceeded to cancel our Mortgage Modification application. We submitted an appeal with proper documentation and proof from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that they withheld our checking account funds. M & T Bank denied our appeal despite the aforementioned documentation. We then began to utilize a housing counselor to attempt to try to work with M & T Bank and reinstate a Mortgage Modification. We submitted a second Mortgage Modification application. Again we were denied by M & T Bank and they claimed because we "" defaulted '' on the previous Mortgage Modification trial they could not approve the application. We again submitted yet another appeal and they again denied the appeal. At this time, they began to file Foreclosure court papers against us and retained lawyers. We have been served said papers and are supposed to have a Mediation meeting scheduled with the local court ; however, this has not happened yet. We have submitted a 3rd Mortgage Modification application through M & T Bank upon M & T 's suggestion and through their respective lawyers. Today we received a 3rd denial of a Mortgage Modification. 
We have tried working out payments with M & T Bank but they are refusing to work with us. We have kept lines of communication open with M & T bank and they are refusing to communicate solutions to us.

XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX : First of all, this is not XXXX XXXX account. Second, XXXX has been called and contacted multiple times with no resolution. 

First of all, I had a home disaster, while we were evacuated from our home, XXXX charged us for it the whole time, Next, I turned in all of their equipment and regardless, I paid the bill monthly and in full. Because of the billing, I changed to XXXX. I paid XXXX in full, they had received all tier equipment and I did, multiple times, call to confirm XXXX balance. 
When I received my credit report, a time later, I was in shock. They claimed a Charge off on the credit reports. In Experians case, the CO is claimed for to whole years, since XXXX. I asked for confirmation and offered to pay what I owed, but they person answering the phone stated I did not owe anything. So, I requested an investigation from both the credit agencies and XXXX. Of course, XXXX states they dd one and the report is accurate, yet, neither Experian and other creditors, to include XXXX will not provide their proff, nor provided me an answer what I owed to them. 

In the mean time, my job questioned a few weeks ago, sine my credit report and what they reported has a high impact on my employment. A charge off is bad, AT this point, I have no idea what was charged off, what I owed ( they stated nothing ) and am disregarded in trying to get this off my credit reports. I am told, when I re engage that they investigated prior and doing NOTHING FURTHER by both credit agencies and XXXX. They are ruining my credit and the credit agency is not holding them to standards, obviously. I get the same feedback, the company states they looked into it and they are reportig accurately - nothing is challenged or provided to me, as requested. I requested time and time again of their findings from both and am ignored. The last time investigation is XXXX XXXX. 

I started this inquiry, years ago, get frustrated and try again. Ultimately, it is very past 30 days of resolution. I want XXXX off my credit report. And if it is on any of my husband`s ( bill I snot in his name ), remove it off is too. 

Also, at my job, XXXX was addressed and if I lose my job on their reporting, this WILL STEP UP! XXXX XXXX is a XXXX  veteran and this will hurt her employment.

In the section below about "" AVOIDING INTEREST ON PURCHASES ( GRACE PERIOD ) '', it said the following : 1 ) If you have a 0 % promotional APR on all of your Purchase balances, you can avoid paying interest on those balances during the applicable promotional period. However, pay at least your Minimum Payment Due to avoid a late fee.

2 ) If you have both Purchase balances with an APR greater than 0 % and you also have other promotional balances on your Account, you can avoid paying interest on your Purchases by paying $ xx ( this amount includes any Minimum Payment Due required to avoid a late fee ).

Then, the next month, I received an interest charge of $ yy, even though the previous statement said that the balance of $ xx had a 0 % APR rate. 

I tried to explain to this to Barclays on the phone, but they refused to acknowledge that their statement ending XX/XX/2019 incorrectly represented the APR on the balance. They also refused to take any responsibility because the prior statement ending XX/XX/2019 explained that interest would start accruing on XX/XX/2019, even though their XX/XX/XXXX statement said the opposite.

I will further specify the innacuracy found, disputed, requested it to be corrected or removed with my supporting evidences provided or stated to your company but still you kept it unchanged against my will and in violation of the law. 
my XXXX XXXX XXXX  credit account number XXXX ( account ending in XXXX ) which I opened on XXXX of year XXXX with credit line of {$5000.00} shows on my credit report as closed which is something I rejected it to those concerned and I also have a legal dispute about it and other issues and with XXXX XXXX XXXX not only as their customer but also as an employee of that bank. 

The innacuracy is the wrong information shown on a new XXXX XXXX XXXX  account number different from the above ( I will name it : cover-up Account ) which is under my Information and XXXX XXXX XXXX was noticed or informed of my rejection of its existence and I believe it is a fraudulent Account opened intentionally by XXXX XXXX XXXX.opening the cover-up Account is fraud and this is a different subject in different case not the primary subject of this complaint which I described above XXXX I believe XXXX XXXX violated the above referenced consent order to open an account with my information and against my will. The cover-up account was opened under my information but against my will,, that is a fact that is not what I disputed with you credit bureau. I further informed you in my dispute that XXXX XXXX account shown open now in my credit report ( or the cover-up account ) never existed and/or recorded in any of my credit reports or my XXXX XXXX XXXX statement at any time prior to the month of XXXX of this year XXXX and there is no way you can prove the opposite of this fact.. It is innacurate Information that cover-up Account is shown now in my current credit report with you as an account that was opened before this year of XXXX. Indeed, that is inaccurate and after I disputed it is still on my credit report as if it was opened in year XXXX or before year XXXX knowing it never existed before XXXX Isnt inaccurate to say that account was opened in year XXXX and it was not.For the credit bureau now and again through the CFPB platform and in this complaint against you, please delete the inacurate information and make sure a complete information is recorded on any of my accounts within your credit bureau. Just deleting when an account opened without further completeness is still in violation the FCRA. You didnt do anything about the inaccurate information as a credit bureau and it is your obligation .For XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX you committed fraud against me by opening that account ending in against my will and reporting it the way it is now on my credit report, with inaccurate information meant to cover up your other violations against me but you are to stay assured that you will be held accountable in court. 

Both the credit bureau and XXXX XXXX XXXX are conspiring against my person. The credit bureau insisting to keep inaccurate information to cover up XXXX XXXX XXXX fraud againt me is illegal. Each one of you is to assume the full legal consequences of your actions that I believe you did againt me in violation of the law. 

whether you are XXXX XXXX XXXX or the credit bureau you are responsible for the accuracy of my information by law especially when I disputed an inaccuracy and/or incorrect information about me and within you control and I proved to you by evidence that account information is inaccurate and/or should never existed XXXX You are obligated to correct the inaccuracy which I believe is Fraud for your knowledge that is wrong and you insist to keep it. I believe you are violating my rights and with recklessness and you were given many chances and enough time but you failed to comply to law and respect your obligations toward my personal data or my information. You must comply to the law XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit bureau. You are going to be sued and no one will stop that without returning to me or my representative and without Waiving my rights and all my rights reserved to me or my representative. 

I consent to the CFPB to view my credit reports before this year XXXX and the current one with the inaccurate information as detailed above. 
The violators has access to what they need to comply with the law and stop their retaliation and harassment almost in daily basis and againt a singled man but protected by law and before that by XXXX.

In my contract with XXXX   XXXX, I had a grace period of the XXXX of each month with no penalties during the grace period. Additionally, there late fee after the XXXX was not stated to be {$60.00}. However, with Lakeview Loan Servicing, there is a fee of $ XXXX- {$15.00} if payments are made during the grace period and not by the XXXX of each month. I do not believe this is acceptable. I did not ask for Lakeview to Service my loan and I find it quite deceitful and unethical to be charged during a grace period. The first time of making my mortgage payment was to Lakeview Loan servicing, which I paid on XX/XX/XXXX, I was not charged a late fee. Why now, but most importantly, why at all. I would like for my original mortgage contract to be honored. Additionally I have filed a complaint with FDIC as no customer should have to experience this type of unethical practice, especially from a mortgage company that they did not chose to have their loan through.

So my XXXX payment was short approximately {$130.00}. Suntrust put my payment in an account and attempted to reach me via phone. They also sent a letter at the end of XXXX ( attached ) which I disregarded as instructed in the letter. The letter does not state that my payment was short, it in correctly stated that they did not receive my payment and if I sent it to disregard the letter. I knew that my payment was sent so I disregarded the letter. Because they did not properly notify me that my payment was short, my XXXX payment went out short {$130.00}. For 12 months prior to this point, I not only made my payment, but actually paid extra on principle, yet Suntrust says they did not know what to do with my payment so they sent it back in check form. They held on to my money, tied it up in a check, and then reported me 30 days past due to the credit bureaus. I only knew something was wrong because my score dropped XXXX points. I have disputed this directly with them, and through the 3 CRA, however Suntrust believes that this process is not only fair, but reporting me 30 dpd is a true reflection upon my risk to them and to other lending institutions even though they had more money of mine than I actually owed because of the shortage payment in full. In 30 years, I have never missed one payment and because of their system limitations and improper notification, I am not unable to say that any more. I have not talked to one person at that organization that has been the least bit helpful with this. I had one person tell me there was no one there that could help me with this. There is nothing logical about this practice and every time I try dispute this, they say it is resolved. It is not resolved, I have attached a recent letter that I received, the correspondence associated with this and the system notes from my account.

Today, XX/XX/2019, an account closing was initiated by said company. I noticed what was done when checking my account online. I then called Popular XXXX to find out what was going on. According to a customer service representative spoken to on the phone, the account was closed due to suspicious activity. No further details or explanations could be given on the case because not enough information was available to the representative. The company failed to inform me of their actions and completely disregarded me as a customer. Also, Popular XXXX failed to contact me to report the suspicious activity. The company then charged a whopping 25 dollar closing fee. This company is clearly using shady business practices to open accounts for new customers, promising them high-interest rates, to then close them days later for their benefit, and charge heinous fees in the process. These actions are completely unfair and should really be taken into account when trying to provide good customer service. I did not commence the account closing and should not have to pay or be charged a fee for actions on behalf of the company. It is completely ludicrous and shows a level of high disregard for customers hard-earned money. I am now 25 dollars short for something I had nothing to do with, and the company is 25 dollars richer. What is the fairness in this? Just another financial institution making false promises to fatten up their wallets.

Representative stated that fees would be waived and if a payment of XXXX was paid, the mortgage would be up to date. Fees were not waived, and additional fees were applied. Since that point each time the payment is made it is applied to a suspense account because fees were not in fact waived as we were told. An additional XXXX was charged on the XXXX XXXX statement because of this. An additional two hours were spent attempting to rectify this matter with Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC to no avail. Again, we were promised that the fees would be waived and that the regular monthly payment ofXXXX would be all that is necessary to be current.  The fees were not waived.  We were contacted yet again from the collection department stating that we needed to make a payment. We were originally set to pay XXXX so that we would not be inaccurately reported to the credit bureaus as delinquent. That payment was canceled when we were assured by a Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC representative that only XXXX plus a XXXX difference would need to be paid. We again complied so that we would not be penalized. In XX/XX/XXXX, yet another late fee has been assessed. In another attempt to clear the situation, we reached out to Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC. This is now the 4th month in a row we have requested remediation and no corrections have been made. Because the payment of XXXX still showed as past due because of fees not being waived, I had to pay an additional XXXX to make the payment. I attempted to make a payment of XXXX online but I was unable to make this directly to the balance due. During this request, I was advised (AGAIN) that fees would be waived and that a payment of XXXX would take care of fees we were somehow responsible for, AND would ensure the payment made of XXXX for XXXX   would suffice. This time the account reflected XXXX in fees that would need to be waived.We called again on XXXX XXXXh and were told that the case should be settled on XX/XX/XXXX. We called yet again on XXXX XXXX and the representatives simply tried to collect a debt and stated that they were unable to help. On top of the fees that continue to accrue due to months of false statements from Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC, we have been unable to take advantage of record low rates because Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC will not show our mortgage as current on a Verification of Mortgage. At this point, we are under the impression that we will not receive any assistance from Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC. We are fortunate that rates have not risen as that would be additional harm to our financial well-being. We are not asking for the difference in interest of what we could have obtained and what we were being charged. We are simply asking Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC to stand by their word and waive all fees from April through the present as agreed upon.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC",VA,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3339973,

2019-08-14,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"After Toys R Us closed, my Toys R Us credit card converted to a Synchrony Bank Mastercard. Since I began using this Synchrony Bank Mastercard, I have frequently been denied use - stuck at gas stations trying to pump gas or on the sidewalk waiting for an XXXX - because of Synchrony Bank Mastercard 's fraud alerts. Although I had permitted fraud alerts to my phone to which I could respond via text message that the charges were not, in fact, fraudulent and that I was still in possession of my card, I have consistently had to call the number on the Bank of my card to have my access to my line of credit restored. This has been happening approximately monthly. Each time I have called to complain, I have asked why my card keeps getting flagged for frozen, despite the fact that I will use my card in the same manner ( i.e. pattern ) for days to weeks at a time before my card is frozen due to suspected fraud, and I have asked each time that I call that my call be logged as a complaint. Despite numerous calls to Synchrony Bank Mastercard, my card continues to be regularly frozen, and I am forced to spend approximately 15 minutes on the phone with Synchrony Bank Mastercard every time I have to call them to unfreeze my card. During at least my last 3 to 4 calls, I have asked that someone call me back either to address my complaint. I have never received a response. 

Recently, my card was declined and frozen on Wednesday, XX/XX/2019 when I was standing at the curb outside of work waiting for an XXXX to take me home. I did not receive a fraud alert text until after I called in to have my card unfrozen. The customer service representative verified all of the charges on the card recently - my train ticket in the morning from the commuter rail, my XXXX from the train station to my job site, and my XXXX from the job site home. Synchrony Bank Mastercard seems incapable of recognizing preauthorization charges ( especially in regard to XXXX ) and automatically freezes cards. I had my call escalated and advised the 2nd customer service representative that I call almost monthly, and I have had enough, to log this as a complaint, and if I do not hear back from someone soon about how this ongoing issue will be resolved, I will be cancelling my card. After I hung up, I saw that I received a call from a Texas number which was apparently someone else at Synchrony Bank Mastercard telling me I could use my card again something the representative I was one the phone with was denying me. By the time I listened to that message, I had already selected another card for use to get myself home. 

Today, on Tuesday, XX/XX/2019, the same thing happened. I tried to book an XXXX home and my card was denied. No text verification. I took out my wallet and called the number on the back of the card. The first representative verified my identity and escalated my call without my asking because he could not unfreeze my card. The 2nd representative advised me that he could not use my primary phone number to unfreeze my card, nor my primary email, and that I would have to provide a second phone or email. I advised him that I did not have one and that the information they have on file for me, that I provided, is correct and should be sufficient. I was told it was insufficient to unfreeze my card. I asked that the call be escalated again. I was told that I was already speaking with a manager and there was no one else to whom to escalate the call. I noted that my card is frozen too often and I will be cancelling my card and that this call should be logged as a complaint and that I will be reporting this pattern of behavior to the CFPB. 

As soon as I use my cash back rewards ( the representative on the phone with me could not tell me what or if I had any in my account ) I intend to cancel this card. Synchrony Bank Mastercard should be examined in regard to their credit card operations, specifically in reference to the Consumer Complaint Response portion of their Compliance Management System as well as for Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices ( UDAAP ). 

Synchrony Bank Mastercard 's frequent freezing of the use of my credit card was unfair. It caused substantial injury to me in stealing from me time and energy calling in to have my card unfrozen on an ongoing basis ; despite my explaining to Synchrony Bank Mastercard the ongoing nature of this problem, my pattern of use, and my wishes that this issue be resolved, the situation did not change or improve and the injury I suffered in lost time and energy as well as the use of the benefits associated with my use of this card ( like when I had to rely on another card ) was not reasonably avoidable by me, despite me best efforts. This injury was not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition because it only inconvenienced me beyond a reasonable standard and discouraged my use of the line of credit I had been rightfully granted.

Synchrony Bank Mastercard 's frequent freezing of the use of my credit card was also deceptive. I was led to believe that Synchrony Bank Mastercard would allow me to use the credit card for which I was approved in a reasonable manner, in accordance with my predictable patterns of us. Instead, I was misled, as demonstrated by Synchrony Bank Mastercards regular denial of my use of the credit card and lack of proactive measures in alerting me of any suspected fraud. My interpretation and expectation of being able to reasonably use the credit card for which I had been approved was reasonable under the circumstances. No other card that I have ever had has been so problematic with one, persistent issue that disabled me from accessing my line of credit. Synchrony Bank Mastercards misrepresentation of its card product is material, as it unreasonably impacted my access to the line of credit for which I had been approved. 

Finally, Synchrony Bank Mastercards frequent freezing of the use of my credit card was abusive. If there were a way for me to prevent the frequent freezing of my card, for me to understand how to stop this frequent denial, Synchrony Bank Mastercard never advised me as to how any time I called, and despite requesting a call back from someone to resolve this issue on several occasions, my request for help was never answered ; one ever reached out or left a message. Synchrony Bank Mastercard took unreasonable advantage of my inability to protect my interests in using the credit card product or service and my reasonable reliance that the customer service staff would respond appropriately to my complaints and help to resolve them. 

The frequency with which the issue occurred is also indicative of an abusive practice, because Synchrony Bank Mastercard was alerted of the issue and failed to respond to either me or its fraud-detection-system dysfunction in a timely or reasonable manner. Synchrony Bank Mastercards lack of response or escalation of my complaints also demonstrates a failing in the Consumer Complaint Response portion of its Compliant Management System. Overall, the financial institution 's disregard of its duties to reasonably honor the line of credit I was granted discouraged me from using my card to the point where I will be winding it down and closing it, and bad faith on the part of a financial institution, generally. 

As an added complaint, every time a customer calls in, they have to provide their full name exactly as it appears on their card, with their middle initial, and Synchrony Bank refuses to change the name on the card to any name other than what is on an individual 's driver 's license, even if that is not the name they commonly go by - unless I was misinformed by their customer service.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,MA,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3340087,

2019-08-14,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"I have requested several times that the PMI be removed from my loan and always formally denied even though after completing renovations my home has appraised way over the 80 % of the loan. I have even received letters from the bank in which I have ( see attached ) the loan with stating my home is worth {$510000.00} and my loan balance is {$300000.00} well under the {$410000.00} limit. I have paid off more than 3 mortgages, have an over 800 credit score, and well over XXXX in savings, and do not see why I am paying over {$200.00} a month in PMI. I am not a risk, and even if I was this mortgage is insured by the government so do not see why an additional PMI payment was ever needed. 

I want the PMI removed from my loan and a refund of the PMI I have already had to lay out in order not to be delinquent with my mortgage. I knew I would be doing major renovations so that is why I did not put down 10 to 20 % down. No where on my loan documents does this say the PMI can never be removed. I want this off my loan. I asked to be shown where I was told this would never be able to come off my loan? I was not given any disclosure and there is no mention of it in my mortgage. I was also informed that stated in the by-laws a request can be made from my mortgage company ( NewRez LLC ) on my behalf to FHA to eliminate the PMI. I feel this fee is very unfair. I have a very low mortgage compared to the value of my home ( {$510000.00} ) and I am willing to get an appraisal to prove this, I have an over 800 FICO score, in the past I have paid off multiple mortgages, I have been employed full time for several years, I never had a late payment on anything!!! I told my mortgage company ... '' Please, I am requesting some customer service. Please put an inquiry to FHA to eliminate this PMI from my loan. '' Also I asked if I have an option to pay down the existing loan of {$320000.00} to an 80 % value {$260000.00} with a payment toward my principal of {$40000.00} which would recast the loan in hopes to eliminate this PMI. They have no proof this was explained to me before hand. I asked them to produce something that was signed and they couldn't. I also asked for a compromise since they can not. Why won't they ask FHA on my behalf to reconsider? 

Would appreciate any assistance you can give. I feel this is a very unfair practice and PMI should be eliminated across the board and money should be given back to not only me but all mortgagors.",Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",NY,11721,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3340206,"40.89,-73.37"

This brings us to this year, in XX/XX/XXXX : I was notified by XXXX about an application for credit that wasn't me through Synchrony Bank ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) This was a match with my SSN, no name and no DOB. ( WOW, its the exact same situation, almost a year later ). called with XXXX to have the application removed and was told I must sign a document that they would send to me in order for it to be removed, verifying that the application was fraudulent. Of course, I asked the name of the thief and they said they couldn't provide it. I also was a bit weirded out that they would ask for a signature, as that hadn't happened with previous banks. ( or the previous time with Synchrony ). They also notified me that the application for credit that was recently placed in a jewelry store in XXXX. When I called the retailers ( the jewelry store ) to get more information ( it didn't look like a real business ), they only spoke XXXX and hung up on me. 

About a week later, my spider sense was tingling, so I called Synchrony back and asked them to clarify a bit more as to why I was asked to complete a signed form for them to take the application off of my file when it obviously was a repeat case ( that seemed weird to me ). I spoke with a different associate who reassured me that I wouldn't be sent anything, that the previous rep was mistaken and not to worry. I confirmed with her and she said that I would NOT have to sign anything. It was taken care of. 

Well, lo and behold, they sent me a letter in XXXX two weeks later XXXX NO ENGLISH translation, no phone number ) addressed to XXXX XXXX, apologizing that she is a victim of identity fraud. The address to send it back to was in English as "" Card Processing '' which is why I called them back, this time the fraud department, and asked again what was going on. 

I called a second time ( to Synchrony Bank ) as I felt an odd sense about the previous call. I told them to check in the fraud department and a woman there told me that there were two credit cards opened tied to my SSN, with no DOB and Name match. The open credit card files and accounts were for a Care Credit card ( XXXX, XXXX AND XXXX ) and Walmart credit card ( XXXX ) ( both through Synchrony Bank ). She confirmed she sent this in letter form to me and I received both notifications addressed to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( one in English, one in XXXX ), both were to apologize for XXXX being a victim of identity theft and that the credit cards ending in XXXX were closed. 

When I received this lovely info, I called again and have been sent two fraud investigation affidavits and am going to attach these to my  XXXX accounts. Additionally, I have received statements of each transaction, store locations and it looks the Walmart ones are being paid off, in store ( at least there's that, I guess ... ..both are {$500.00} credit limits ). 

I am truly at a loss. Every time I call credit bureaus, XXXX, Banks, they all advise me to place a freeze on all three credit bureaus and a 7 year feud alert -- -I HAVE A FREEZE PER EACH BUREAU, AS WELL AS THE 7 YEAR ALERT ON ALL AGENCIES. When an associate of XXXX called XXXX with me, they verified I had no credit accounts with Care Credit, Walmart or new application alerts on my report. 

I asked them why there was another credit file created tied to my SSN. He ran a report and cross referenced my SSN and found there was a separate credit profile/file for XXXX XXXX ( as well as XXXX XXXX and likely XXXX XXXX ) with different DOB and address with those credit files open, separate from my file. 

The issue now is that there has been another person ( name is XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) with MY social security number. I also received a notification from the IRS in XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX to notify me that my SSN was used to obtain employment in XXXX and they placed a marker on my tax account as a victim of identity fraud. ( That year I also received a from the IRS previously notifying me in XXXX that someone filed taxes with my SSN -- this was a follow up ). This ALL terrifies me and is getting super NOT fun when I have to take off work to deal with this ( it's so lame to get 4-5 different answers from Synchrony ). EACH TIME AN APPLICATION GOES THROUGH, each of these happened AFTER I placed a security freeze on all 3 bureaus, with an extended 7 year fraud alert ) : ( here is the history ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXXe ( flagged /fraud, let 's hope ) ( SSN match only ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX Card ( flagged, fraud let 's hope ) ( SSN match only ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXXt AGAIN ( Application alert, no marker although there was a case opened, resolved and closed with XXXX as Power of Attorney XXXX notarized police reports, affidavits, FTC , etc, documents proving identity as mine, alone ) XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Application ( name, DOB and SSN match ) shut down XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX ( Application, flagged AGAIN and still attempting to go through ) XX/XX/XXXX Synchrony Bank XXXX Financing ( Application flagged, wanted me to sign documentation, then when calling back, they gave 2 sets of different instructions and notified me of two fraudulent accounts/credit cards opened and active when cross-referencing my SSN ... .and the saga continues below ) Now : When I previously opened up a legal and police report with XXXX and ran credit reports through all three bureaus, I identified several accounts NOT mine. I notified the agencies, through XXXX ( ALL on file ) and identified the following information on my credit report : Addresses in XXXX XXXX, CA and XXXX, CA ( both contested and removed from my credit reports ). I also notified all bureaus that the XXXX XXXX Care Credit card ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX and Walmart credit card ( XXXX ) ( both through Synchrony Bank ) were fraudulent and removed from my credit report. Also, the XXXX XXXX account which was also fraudulent and removed. All was removed and supposedly flagged as fraudulent! 

Unfortunately, Synchrony, as well as the credit bureaus, created a separate, synthetic credit file and stupidly, sent the tracking of all credit activities and card numbers to me in the mail, along with confirmation that poor "" XXXX XXXX and XXXX '' were identified as "" victims ''. When I called AGAIN, the woman at Wallmart fraud alerts was blatantly rude, abrasive and after many attempts of trying to resolve the issues and get the correct information ( she also insinuated I was stupid ), she interupted me and placed me on hold. I waited and no return so I hung up and called back. Twice. Different answers BOTH times. Finally, they sent me a fraud affadavit and I completed both forms and sent it in. 

I called XXXX and they confirmed that there was a synthetic file and told me they would have Special Handling call and resolve it. Yesterday, they called and had no idea what I was talking about and that they could not do that. 

When I called to have these removed, I was told they would write me to confirm these were flagged as fraudulent and would remove these from the synthetic credit file. 

When notifying the credit bureaus last year and banks -- they were notified of the fraudulent activity/accounts and instead of actually closing and eliminating and flagging the synthetic files, they simply transferred it into a false credit file. This is a huge issue that proves these bureaus are negligent in simply running SSN searches as they continue to let this happen. SHAME ON THE continual offenders : Synchrony, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( as well as XXXX, who should have flagged the name, DOB and SSN as fine AS A FROZEN CREDIT ACCOUNT and removed the application inquiry ). 

Is there a way to shut the separate file off and to make sure my information is protected moving forward? Why am I paying for a credit freeze and fraud alert if the bureaus themselves are dirty????? 

It looks like if she were to default on these, it will impact me. 

How do I keep this from happening AGAIN. If it's this easy for them to create fraudulent accounts and use my SSN, can no one help me??? 

I just purchased the credit monitoring through XXXX as well ( again, frozen and locked there too ). Is that just setting myself up for another breach to get XXXX XXXX again as well? XXXX has been my only source of comfort and even then, the banks and bureaus don't seem to care or follow the law.

Latest unresolved problem : I had received kitchen cabinets that were damaged and had errors in the order that were charged on my credit card in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. When the merchant wasn't responsive to resolve, I disputed the two charges on my credit card, XXXX Visa by Barclay Bank. My first being, they failed to register my dispute and charge back until months later ( XX/XX/XXXX ) when I followed up. The merchant noticing this charge back months after deliver of the cabinets filed a police report. Even though not resolved, I wasn't willing to turn a civil case into a criminal one and I removed the dispute in XX/XX/XXXX. I was finally rebilled on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$2000.00} and {$830.00} ). The merchant claimed he was not credited and filed a mechanics lien on a housing co-op property where I live. I called multiple times and mailed a letter asking for proof the merchant was paid. I never received the letter that I was first asking for nor did I receive the details I requested. I requested what day and time was the merchant issued the payment, what manner of payment, and what merchant account was issued the credit. The matter is now urgent with 3rd party lawyers for the housing co-op involved that are threatening to hold me accountable for the legal fees if the mechanics lien is not removed within the next week. I tried to explain the urgency with multiple calls and with multiple representatives on XX/XX/XXXX to no avail. Instead, I get customer service representatives at Barclay Bank who laugh at me and give me a reprogrammed response. This is the norm, not the exception when dealing with Barclay Bank.

I obtained two credit cards from Synchrony Financial. One Lowes Credit on XX/XX/XXXX and one WalMart Credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On that or around XX/XX/XXXX Both accounts became delinquent. According to XXXX Courts and Judicial Procedure Limitation of Actions According to TITLE 10 8106 Actions subject to 3-year limitation.

As a New York State Resident The Court of Appeals of the State of New York XXXX XXXX v. King held that the statute of limitations of the state where the credit card issuer is based, rather than New York 's statute, may be correct statute of limitations to apply. In this case 3 years.

2019-08-14,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Problem getting a working replacement card,"I opened up a new credit card with Citi Bank over a month ago. I already have one card with them, and I opened the new card with all the same info ( name, phone, address, etc ) Now, after 6 weeks and hours on the phone and online chat with them, I still haven't received the card. I pulled my credit report and the card is being reported on my credit report to all the bureaus, even though the card is not yet activated and I have never received the card. Is that legal?

One customer service rep today said the card has been returned to them as returned mail twice for wrong address. After an hour on the phone we finally discovered that Citi has a different zip code than is listed on my online profile and account. However, they still haven't changed the zip for me, even though it goes to a nonexistent address. They keep saying the will call me back, but fail to do so. At this point its been over a month, the card is on my consumer credit reports with all the bureaus, and I have no access to it. It doesn't look like I'm ever going to get the card in the mail, and I literally can not get anyone from customer service ( either online, fraud department, customer service department, new account opening department ) to follow up with me and fix the issue. It just seems absurd that no one at Citi is able to fix a Zip Code error that is only showing up on their end. I even tried to just cancel the card, but they said I can't because it isn't showing up on my online profile yet ... because I haven't activated it yet.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,92014,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3340581,"32.97,-117.24"

2019-08-13,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Some background first. On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a televison from HH Gregg, in order to get free interest I had to take a card out which was filled out by the clerk and not until after paying the card off did I realize my last name was misspelled, the letter i was in place of an e. I added a washer and dryer on XX/XX/XXXX with the same no interest promotion and paid it all off on XX/XX/XXXX without any interest due. I did not use the card again and let it expire. 
In XXXX of XXXX I discovered an email from Synchrony stating I owed {$3800.00} plus dollars, I contacted the local police and made a report explaining someone somehow used my information I also contacted Sychrony and the call taker explained I would not be responsible. A couple days later I'm telling my son who has the same name but has his own home and he says he and his wife  had applied for a card from Synchony and received one and charged about that same amount. ( we have had issues with the post office sending our mail to each others home ). I recontacted Sychrony to try and get this resolved and my son also called them to try and get it fixed by having the bills go to him  on a new account not tied to me. I was also told I had to fill out a fraud statement which I did. My son gave me the card he received and it was a new number I had never been issued but it was still spelled wrong. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I received a response from Synchrony stating the bill was my responsibily since it was family. I called the fraud department and reiterated that my son was an adult and did not live in my house so he was not a household member nor was he ever on my original credit card, only myself. Also I was told they did not have an application from my son in the computer, however I was shown a heading from Synchony to my son sent to his address. I also received another email stating I had a new card and to activate it. Since I did not want a new credit card to begin with I never activated this card but Synchony took the charges my son made on the second card and transferred them to this third card which was not activated. 
I cant imagine some of this is legal. If it is any child of any age ( even ones who have broken off all contact with parents ) could intercept their parents mail and buy all sorts of things and never be responsible for any of it. How can credit card companies activate cards without the recipient accepting the card let alone switching from card to card.Why have a number to call to activate if they can do it without your permission. My son is XXXX years old, has his own family but Synchony is saying I'm still responsible. Seems pretty unethical. Additionally does my name being misspelled play any role at this point?

I filed a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX that was converted to a Chapter XXXX in XXXX. I also had a car loan and 2 installment loans with the same company. Upon converting to Chapter XXXX, I reaffirmed the car loan and the installment loans. These loans have subsequently been paid in full. Payment history was given to the credit bureaus each month. 
Virginia bankruptcy law does not allow the reaffirmation of mortgage loans, therefore, I was unable to reaffirm those loans. I have paid these loans on time every month, before and after filing the Chapter XXXX. My payment history for the mortgage loans is not being reported to the three credit bureaus. 
I was told that they choose not to report because I am not "" truly obligated '' to pay because the loans were discharged. I can continue to make the payments and when the loans are paid in full the deed will be released. 
I get mortgage statements every month, pay the bill via bank transfer, my homeowners insurance and taxes are paid from an escrow account, and I receive documentation for tax purposes at the end of the year. Everything is handled by this credit union except the bureau reports! This is arbitrary and capricious and disparate treatment. I pay my bill on time like other customers who have not found it necessary to file for bankruptcy protection. Why are my payments not reported? 
I was told that I could always refinance with another institution. I currently have a 4 % first mortgage. 
Not having my current mortgage payments reported, has had a detrimental impact on my credit score.  Therefore, refinancing will cost me thousands of dollars and add years to the loan.

Two days went by and since I was still suffering sleepless nights and now irritated because of not receiving adequate rest and since I still had not received a call, I contacted Stash again and told the representative that I was renting a truck and will be returning the mattress that day because it only were we caused sleepless nights but the base had stopped working. 
That afternoon a guest relations representative contacted me and told me that I had to sleep at least 30 days on the mattress to comply with the warranty. I called the Stash store and spoke to XXXX manager of the store to explain how both my fianc and I are suffering sleeplessness due to this product and the base is not working. XXXX kindly informed us that the base was accidentally reset and helped to fix the base issue However XXXX politely explained that sleeping on the bed takes getting use to and to try it for at least 30 days.

I started a new job and almost drifted to sleep in front of my peers and superiors due to not sleeping at night. I really need to sleep as it has now been weeks since I have had a good night 's rest. 
We were told we must sleep with a mattress pad on the bed to maintain the warranty and therefore we have the highest quality, thickest, and most expensive mattress pad on the bed since day one which is also a reason we can not feel any cooling of the mattress. The mattress pad protects the bed but also makes the bed warmer which causes for us to experience an influx of heat. 
Because we had already done 1 exchange, XXXX stated that he could not approve the return of the bed however he would reach out to the guest relations team to contact me. 
The following day guest relations contacted me and stated that they would not be able to return and refund the mattress when I discuss the reasons why the agents simply stated that we did not sleep on the bed for full 30 nights and since the bet was already Exchanged one time they could not honor the return of the bed although there is a 90 day satisfactory guarantee on the bed. 
I asked the rep if the Ashley store could return and refund the bed and she stated that decision would have to be made by the manager I have since left several messages and now no one is contacting me back we continue to suffer sleepless nights I have made a XXXX appointment due to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that Im suffering from sleeping on this bed and again night after night I have to sleep on my sofa Instead of an {$8000.00} bed. This is not only been the worst experience Ive ever had with a purchase but I am now seeking assistance from the XXXX XXXX XXXX and Attorney General with this matter I just want to return and refund this bird purchase. I even told the store that Im willing to purchase a mattress with a some type of pillow top version Since I realize the reason theyre not allowing me to return and refund this bed is because they do not want to lose this large purchase in their store However no one should suffer this amount of pain and sleepless nights from a store recommended purchase.

Loan officer XXXX XXXX, and backed by his supervisor XXXX XXXX Complaint : On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, 2019, I had conversations with loan officer about a refinancing. I told him I had started an application with another lender. This loan officer quoted me interest rate of 3.87, a quarter point lower than the first lender I had an application with. We continue discussion as if this was a conventional agency loan, and there was NO mention whatsoever that this was a special bank portfolio loan. I go ahead and cancel my application with first lender and start an application with Suntrust based on the loan officer 's quote and thinking this was a straight forward agency product. 
Sure enough to my surprise, the next day after I start application and start uploading documents, I learn that he sold me a portfolio product. This is product underwritten for the bank 's own portfolio and not per the well known standards of conventional agency loans. This product requires different financial criteria that are different from bank to bank. It is very different than your regular conventional agency loan with well known standard financial criteria for approval. 
The loan officer mislead me into this product with the lower rate but said nothing that this is the special portfolio product. I could not believe he intentionally chose not to disclose the special nature of this loan and it's underwriting criteria. 
I request to cancel my application because did not want to take a chance with the bank 's own underwriting criteria which often involves the judgment or the individual underwriter, unlike the agency conventional products that have standard financial ratio 's. 
When I complained to the supervisor, the supervisor backed the loan officer, and that the portfolio loan type is not a material information to disclose.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"SUNTRUST BANKS, INC.",VA,No00,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3338423,

I received response back from this company through CFPB status update which states company is still working on issue. 

Please be aware this companies response is only to comply with the CFPB 15 day response requirement. Ive been disputing with XXXX XXXX for almost 3 years in regard to this debt which isnt mines. This is very frustrating can you please forward this complaint as well to the FTC. This company doesnt respond to disputes and has not followed the 30 day response or delete rule. This company doesnt respond to disputes regardless of how a person disputes debts. 

Their response after 3 years is unacceptable. I Also used XXXX, TransUnion and XXXX dispute system to document dispute. Again no response in regard to dispute. When I call this company they are oblivious to the dispute. Please remove from credit file they are years past the deadline and they do not follow federal guidelines. Please look into this company. Below is the original verbiage from my first CFPB dispute. Please have this company delete false debt from my credit profile this is very upsetting as a consumer. Thank you all for your help. Original Complaint : Thank you for your help. Ive contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in regard to a Dental Debt - XXXX XXXX. I let XXXX know that the debt isnt mine it is in fact my childs fathers debt. Which he also agrees is his. Both my childrens father and my son have the same name. We used to all attend the same Dental office years ago. A mistake was made by XXXX XXXX Im charging my Sons fathers XXXX  XXXX to my son and Is insurance. At the time my son was only XXXX. Theres no way these are his charges. My insurance clearly list my son and I as beneficiaries. As me and my childrens father were never married. He is not entitled to benefits as he is not my spouse. Part 2 - My son and I moved to XXXX which is by the XXXX XXXX which is 2 hours or so from XXXXXXXX XXXX. We havent been patients in almost 5 years. I reached out to XXXX XXXX. They found the error in their billing and admitted the mistake but stated the debt has been sold and I needed to resolve with XXXX- I have written numerous dispute letters with no response only to receive phone calls about how I would like to pay for debt. Ive provided SSN and address of my childrens father per their request and his consent but yet the debt is still on my credit file and increases by XXXX $ every month which drops my score by about 12 points every month due to increase in collection balance. The debt is not mines its been verified by XXXX as a mistake made with the names. They verified my childrens father signed consent for treatment and for the surgery fees. Making the debt not mine. This company needs to be investigated on an 18 month CFPB look back due to their acts and practices. Violations to look for : - language of their debt practices unclear - threating words and behavior - Not putting dispute status on credit report - Not responding to debt validation letters - improper handling of others SSN numbers and not getting a written agreement to use someone elses SSN number IE my childrens father- I should not have been able to provide his SSN number without his written or verbal consent. Or being asked identifying questions. - company violates Privacy Act - company also partakes in frivolous fee charges. Please  look back 18 months into this companies policies, many people do not know that consumers have the right to dispute and for their debts to be validated and reported accurately.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

I have been given the runaround for months now, with BofA representatives refusing to give me straight answers at first, and ultimately denying my requests for reimbursement of the funds. 

On XX/XX/2019, I saw that on XX/XX/2019, {$6000.00} had been withdrawn from one of my checking accounts and {$2000.00} had been withdrawn from another checking account. 

On that same day, I went into the XXXX XXXX, California BofA branch, where I have been banking for years, and spoke with XXXX, the branch manager. XXXX informed me that the only way I could recover my money was if I obtained a subpoena from a court, requiring them to look through their recorded video to confirm that it wasnt me that had actually withdrawn the money. I objected to having to go to court to challenge the fraudulent withdrawal, but XXXX insisted that this was my only recourse. 

I then contacted XXXX, explaining that I was the familys attorney, and was told the same thing. I told her that BofA has established processes in place to investigate fraudulent transactions, and I was sure they didnt include requiring customers to hire legal counsel to obtain a subpoena to investigate a matter. XXXX seemed extremely flustered and asked if she could research the matter and then call me back. I told her I was appalled at her inability to handle the situation, and said I would await her callback. 

In the meantime, my sister, who had previously served as an insurance fraud investigator, contacted BofA 's fraud department to report the activity. On XX/XX/2019, a representative named "" XXXX '' worked with me to file claims, and he told me he would send me a form to fill out. I never received these promised forms. 

On XX/XX/2019 and on XX/XX/2019, I received denials of my claim, stating that my debit card and PIN number had been entered for the withdrawal. 

On XX/XX/2019, I requested that they reopen the claim, explaining that it is a well-known scam for perpetrators to skim card and PIN information from bank machines. I was told that they would review the claim again, this time pulling video, and asked that I give them up until XX/XX/XXXX to respond. I never received a response. 

On XX/XX/2019, I called again and spoke with XXXX, who told me to send in yet another claim form, as they didnt have any of my previous claim forms.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CA,92823,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-12,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3337624,"33.93,-117.82"

I never applied for it. I was victim of Identity Theft, somebody stole my personal information to open credit cards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,33426,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-12,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3338080,"26.53,-80.08"

2019-08-12,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Bounced checks or returned payments,"On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a stop payment request for a charge in the amount of {$190.00} ; I was charged a {$31.00} fee for this. A few days went by and I was not made aware of the status of the stop payment order so I reached out to the bank on XXXX to get more information. I was told that since the transaction posted before I placed the stop payment order on my account a claim was filed instead.From my understanding of the process a temporary credit would be placed on the account for the transaction amount and there is also not a fee for this service. I requested to have the {$31.00} credited back to my account ; the representatives I spoke with were unwilling to do this. The reason why the claim was filed is because the charges were unexpected and it would cause a financial hardship for me because I also had a very important payment that would be coming out of my account soon. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to debit my mortgage payment from my account in the amount of {$1900.00}. At the time I had {$1900.00} in my account ; I was under the impression that a temporary credit in the amount of {$190.00} would be applied to my account for the claim that was in process. I deposited the cash I had on hand on XX/XX/XXXX and expected that my mortgage payment would be cleared. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I got up on Saturday morning to discover that my mortgage payment had been returned. I looked further into this and from my perspective if the {$31.00} fee had been waived for the stop payment and also the temporary credit placed on my account for {$190.00} my account would have had sufficient funds to cover the transaction. The bank also changed the order of transactions that came into my account ; there was an additional charge of {$38.00} from my credit card company that they allowed to post and sent the payment back to XXXX XXXX. I know for sure that XXXX XXXX debited the money from my account first ; if any payment was returned it should have been the {$38.00} payment, and once again if the {$31.00} stop payment fee had been credited back to my account in this situation I would have had enough funds in my account to cover the payment from XXXX XXXX.If I would have known that I was not going to have a temporary credit on my account right away I would have deposited more money which is what I did on Saturday morning when I realized the payment had been returned. 

My main issue is that the bank sent back a payment that should have been covered in which now my credit is at risk. I sent in a request on XX/XX/XXXX requesting that they immediately reconcile this situation by contacting XXXX XXXX to cover the payment. As a 15 year customer I expected better treatment from WellsFargo than what I received. They have been in a position to capitalize off of me for years, I have paid thousands in fees over the years that I have had my account and I have always managed to keep my account open and active no matter how bad things got for me financially. However, in this situation I was not experiencing a hardship at all, I had more than enough money to cover the payment. Due to a miscommunication about the process I walked away with a different understanding. I don't think I should have to suffer because of this.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MN,55123,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-12,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3337442,"44.8,-93.14"
